The event was scheduled for the last week of August.The government had formed a high level committee under Minister of State for Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation Dhan Bahadur Buda.The event would have cost the government almost Rs 1 billion.

Another Rs 200 million will have to be spent in that,\" the member told Setopati.Millions will also have to be spent on security for the guests and awards taking the expenditure to almost Rs 1 billion.NTB CEO Joshi, however, claimed that the money will be wellspent providing unprecedented promotion for Nepal. \"This is an event with a viewership greater than that of Oscars.

The lawsuit called her ongoing allegations of domestic abuse categorically and demonstrably false.They were part of an elaborate hoax to generate positive publicity for Ms. Heard and advance her career, the lawsuit said, claiming that she is the perpetrator.The suit said Depp, 55, has suffered financial losses because of the accusations, including being dropped from his role as Capt. Jack Sparrow in the Pirates of the Caribbean films.In her article, published in the Post in December, Heard also said she lost an acting role and contract with a major fashion brand because went public with her claims of abuse.I spoke up against sexual violence  and faced our cultures wrath, the 32yearold actress wrote, adding that she felt as those she was on trial in the court of public opinion.Heards publicists and attorney did not return phone calls or emails from The Associated Press seeking comment on Saturday.In a statement to People magazine, her attorney Eric M.

       " '                          Billy Porter, speaking to Vogue before he walked the Oscars red carpet, knew what he was in for among some social media usersPeople are going to be really uncomfortable with my black ass in a ball gown, but its not anybodys business but mine.The remark from the Tonywinning stage performer, actor and singer was both prescient and disproven. There was megapraise for his velvet custom tuxedo look by Christian Siriano and outrage over the notion that an African American man in a dress was a threat to black masculinity.It was just the conversation Porter had hoped to provoke, not to collect virulent hate but to help move along the idea that we all deserve respect, across racial lines and the gender divide.I was ready to create the conversation, Porter told The Associated Press in a phone interview Monday the day after the Oscars. We have to teach people how to treat us, we have to teach people how to love us, we have to teach people how to respect us, and the only way we do that is to respect ourselves.Porter, the black and gay breakout star of the boundaryexpanding FX series Pose, spent awards season using fashion as political art, as he describes it. There were previous dresses, and there was help from powerhouses Tom Ford and Michael Kors in the later weeks, along with smaller designers who embrace a greater gender fluidity in their collections and were thrilled early on to dress him.As a nominee at the Golden Globes, Porters custom trouser look by Randi Rahm, including a huge, hot pinklined cape and floral embellishments, grabbed attention, but social media support and disdain after the 49yearold took to the Oscars carpet took the debate into the stratosphere.Porter understands where established notions of black masculinity originated, and he understands how toxic they can be. He and his stylist, Sam Ratelle, also realize how rigid genderdriven taboos can be and want to help the walls come down.It goes all the way back to the earliest of emasculations, which is slavery, so the only way to sort of overcome that is to be the strongest and the most masculine and the most powerful and now, what has become toxic, Porter said. And I dont think its just black people. I think its men in general. Every ethnicity has their version of it.Porter couldnt care less about negative comments.The comments are not my business. What people think about what Im doing is not my business. I lived that already, he said. Im inside of my authenticity and the whole point is that you have to respect me as much as I respect you. If you dont like it, go somewhere else. You dont have to look. Its not about you. I dont understand why my putting on a dress causes this much strife in your life.Ratelle said he began working with Porter about a year ago.He said, ‘I want to be a piece of walking art, and we just went from there, Ratelle said. Its been really awesome to work with a bunch of great designers. Randi Rahm was certainly completely open. Issey Miyake was fantastic for the Radio City show (Porter was a study in white). Christian Siriano, the fact that he did this custom gown in one week, was incredible after saying, ‘Absolutely. Theres no question well do this. Michael Kors has been the most gracious human. So has Tom Ford.Porter said hes just getting started in terms of pushing along the conversation.People are actually listening, he said. I hope it opens up a dialogue of healing. I will always continue to do me. If theres anything Ive learned in the 49 years that Ive lived on this planet, is that being authentic is the only version of the story that anybody should be.Porter has always been a fashion lover. This year, he was an ambassador for the Council of Fashion Designers of America for mens fashion week in New York and attended a variety of shows featuring a variety of looks, from traditional to gender fluid.Now that awards season is over, and the fashion week cycle is finishing up in Paris, Porter said hell continue to wear whatever he likes, with a great number of designers on board to help with pulls from their lines and custom outfits.PreGolden Globes it was difficult, he said of options available to him, considering that hes not sample size. After the Golden Globes it has not been difficult. You work with the people who work with you. You walk through the doors that are open. Im never a beggar.In real life, or at least on live TV during the Oscars, Helen Mirren appeared ready for change, noting that both she and her copresenter, Jason Momoa, were dressed in pink.It just goes to show, doesnt it, that these days a Hawaiian god and a very mature Englishwoman can actually wear the same color. We can both wear pink, she said to claps.Momoa agreed Finally. The times are changin.',\n",

       " '                          Two years ago he made the whole world dance with Despacito, but Luis Fonsi says he is still a romantic singer and is ready to show all his cards Friday with his new album, Vida.Many people thought I moved away from that romantic side and I always said ‘I havent, Im not going anywhere. I am still a romantic singer, I still talk that romantic language. But at the same time I like to do both things. I dont like to be limited, Fonsi said in a recent interview with The Associated Press, in Spanish.Vida is his ninth studio album and his first in five years, a time of big changes in his life and his career  especially since 2016, when the birth of his son Rocco overlapped with that of the song that gave him international stardom and a broader exposure to Latin music. The original Despacito video, featuring Daddy Yankee, is still the most watched in the history of YouTube with over 5.9 billion views to date its remix with Justin Bieber remains among the top three songs on Billboards list of Hot Latin Songs.Both versions are included in the album, along with the previouslyreleased singles Echame la culpa with Demi Lovato, Calypso with Stefflon Don, Imposible with Ozuna and Sola. It also includes new romantic songs and one powerful torch song that challenged Fonsis vocal chords. One of the most personal pieces is Ahi estas tu, which he wrote to his son Rocco. (His previous album, 8, included a tune for his daugher Mikaela.)There are 15 songs total that cover or fuse Latin pop, RB, dembow, reggaeton and other genres.I want to be able to dance, make people rejoice, and sometimes sing a ballad with a lot of lyric, a lot of emotion, said the Puerto Rican singersongwriter.The touching RBinfused, pianoled ballad Dime que no te irás is also, according to Fonsi, the most difficult to perform vocally.It is one of the songs with more weight in this album, he said. Its one of those songs that may not have the commercial value of others, but it does have the musical and emotional value.He also highlighted his latest single, Sola, a ballad that you may not hear in a club but that will make you nod to its beat.Its neither the typical depressing ballad nor a rhythmic pop song and much less a reggaeton, but its a hybrid of the new sound of pop and that is something that Ive always liked to do  to innovate, to suggest new things to my audience and always to follow my own path.In regards to the title Vida, he said he chose it because the album is kind of an Xray of his life.These songs come from very honest, real places. Many have to do with me, many dont. But I felt that my life is there, in each song, said Fonsi, remembering himself running between the studio to his house to other professional commitments while his wife was pregnant, Rocco was born and starting to grow. That life, that excitement, that love that you feel as a father for a child, the most pure and intense form of love  its impossible not to reflect that in my music, in the way I communicate. ‘Vida is all that. Its my life.',\n",

She studied at the Berklee College of Music in Boston in the United States.The office of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was quick to congratulate the winner. Gray is the fourth Filipina to be named Miss Universe.Ms. Gray truly made the entire Philippines proud when she sashayed on the global stage and showcased the genuine qualities defining a Filipina beauty confidence, grace, intelligence and strength in the face of tough challenges, he said in a statement from the presidential palace.

Duterte raised even more controversy when he recently joked that he smoked marijuana to deal with his busy schedule of meetings with other Asian leaders at a regional summit.Asked what she thought about legalizing marijuana, Gray said Im for it being used for medical use, but not so for recreational use. Because I think if people will argue, then what about alcohol and cigarettes Everything is good but in moderation.This years Miss Universe competition included the firstever transgender contestant, Angela Ponce of Spain. She said in a video presentation that it was not important for her to win but was more important for her to be here.One of the few controversies of this years contest involved Miss United States, Sarah Rose Summers, seeming to mock contestants from Cambodia and Vietnam over their English language skills. Summers apologized.The finale was again hosted by Steve Harvey who infamously announced the wrong winner in the 2015 contest. Harvey joked briefly about the incident in exchanges with contestants and said You all cant let that go and Im still here.The theme of this years pageant was Empowered Women and was judged by seven women including former pageant winners, businesswomen and a fashion designer.',\n",

       " '                          Billy Porter, speaking to Vogue before he walked the Oscars red carpet, knew what he was in for among some social media usersPeople are going to be really uncomfortable with my black ass in a ball gown, but its not anybodys business but mine.The remark from the Tonywinning stage performer, actor and singer was both prescient and disproven. There was megapraise for his velvet custom tuxedo look by Christian Siriano and outrage over the notion that an African American man in a dress was a threat to black masculinity.It was just the conversation Porter had hoped to provoke, not to collect virulent hate but to help move along the idea that we all deserve respect, across racial lines and the gender divide.I was ready to create the conversation, Porter told The Associated Press in a phone interview Monday the day after the Oscars. We have to teach people how to treat us, we have to teach people how to love us, we have to teach people how to respect us, and the only way we do that is to respect ourselves.Porter, the black and gay breakout star of the boundaryexpanding FX series Pose, spent awards season using fashion as political art, as he describes it. There were previous dresses, and there was help from powerhouses Tom Ford and Michael Kors in the later weeks, along with smaller designers who embrace a greater gender fluidity in their collections and were thrilled early on to dress him.As a nominee at the Golden Globes, Porters custom trouser look by Randi Rahm, including a huge, hot pinklined cape and floral embellishments, grabbed attention, but social media support and disdain after the 49yearold took to the Oscars carpet took the debate into the stratosphere.Porter understands where established notions of black masculinity originated, and he understands how toxic they can be. He and his stylist, Sam Ratelle, also realize how rigid genderdriven taboos can be and want to help the walls come down.It goes all the way back to the earliest of emasculations, which is slavery, so the only way to sort of overcome that is to be the strongest and the most masculine and the most powerful and now, what has become toxic, Porter said. And I dont think its just black people. I think its men in general. Every ethnicity has their version of it.Porter couldnt care less about negative comments.The comments are not my business. What people think about what Im doing is not my business. I lived that already, he said. Im inside of my authenticity and the whole point is that you have to respect me as much as I respect you. If you dont like it, go somewhere else. You dont have to look. Its not about you. I dont understand why my putting on a dress causes this much strife in your life.Ratelle said he began working with Porter about a year ago.He said, ‘I want to be a piece of walking art, and we just went from there, Ratelle said. Its been really awesome to work with a bunch of great designers. Randi Rahm was certainly completely open. Issey Miyake was fantastic for the Radio City show (Porter was a study in white). Christian Siriano, the fact that he did this custom gown in one week, was incredible after saying, ‘Absolutely. Theres no question well do this. Michael Kors has been the most gracious human. So has Tom Ford.Porter said hes just getting started in terms of pushing along the conversation.People are actually listening, he said. I hope it opens up a dialogue of healing. I will always continue to do me. If theres anything Ive learned in the 49 years that Ive lived on this planet, is that being authentic is the only version of the story that anybody should be.Porter has always been a fashion lover. This year, he was an ambassador for the Council of Fashion Designers of America for mens fashion week in New York and attended a variety of shows featuring a variety of looks, from traditional to gender fluid.Now that awards season is over, and the fashion week cycle is finishing up in Paris, Porter said hell continue to wear whatever he likes, with a great number of designers on board to help with pulls from their lines and custom outfits.PreGolden Globes it was difficult, he said of options available to him, considering that hes not sample size. After the Golden Globes it has not been difficult. You work with the people who work with you. You walk through the doors that are open. Im never a beggar.In real life, or at least on live TV during the Oscars, Helen Mirren appeared ready for change, noting that both she and her copresenter, Jason Momoa, were dressed in pink.It just goes to show, doesnt it, that these days a Hawaiian god and a very mature Englishwoman can actually wear the same color.

I am still a romantic singer, I still talk that romantic language. But at the same time I like to do both things. I dont like to be limited, Fonsi said in a recent interview with The Associated Press, in Spanish.Vida is his ninth studio album and his first in five years, a time of big changes in his life and his career  especially since 2016, when the birth of his son Rocco overlapped with that of the song that gave him international stardom and a broader exposure to Latin music. The original Despacito video, featuring Daddy Yankee, is still the most watched in the history of YouTube with over 5.9 billion views to date its remix with Justin Bieber remains among the top three songs on Billboards list of Hot Latin Songs.Both versions are included in the album, along with the previouslyreleased singles Echame la culpa with Demi Lovato, Calypso with Stefflon Don, Imposible with Ozuna and Sola. It also includes new romantic songs and one powerful torch song that challenged Fonsis vocal chords. One of the most personal pieces is Ahi estas tu, which he wrote to his son Rocco. (His previous album, 8, included a tune for his daugher Mikaela.)There are 15 songs total that cover or fuse Latin pop, RB, dembow, reggaeton and other genres.I want to be able to dance, make people rejoice, and sometimes sing a ballad with a lot of lyric, a lot of emotion, said the Puerto Rican singersongwriter.The touching RBinfused, pianoled ballad Dime que no te irás is also, according to Fonsi, the most difficult to perform vocally.It is one of the songs with more weight in this album, he said. Its one of those songs that may not have the commercial value of others, but it does have the musical and emotional value.He also highlighted his latest single, Sola, a ballad that you may not hear in a club but that will make you nod to its beat.Its neither the typical depressing ballad nor a rhythmic pop song and much less a reggaeton, but its a hybrid of the new sound of pop and that is something that Ive always liked to do  to innovate, to suggest new things to my audience and always to follow my own path.In regards to the title Vida, he said he chose it because the album is kind of an Xray of his life.These songs come from very honest, real places. Many have to do with me, many dont. But I felt that my life is there, in each song, said Fonsi, remembering himself running between the studio to his house to other professional commitments while his wife was pregnant, Rocco was born and starting to grow. That life, that excitement, that love that you feel as a father for a child, the most pure and intense form of love  its impossible not to reflect that in my music, in the way I communicate. ‘Vida is all that.

But the jump was outside Grand Canyon National Park on the Navajo Nation. The tribes reservation borders the east rim of the national park.A Navajo medicine man gave Smith a blessing and thanked him for coming to the reservation.Smith said the bungee jump was a challenge from Yes Theory, a YouTube channel that makes videos of people doing activities outside of their comfort zone. But the event also raised money for charity through an online lottery for a chance to watch the jump in person. The proceeds will benefit access to education for children in struggling countries.']"
