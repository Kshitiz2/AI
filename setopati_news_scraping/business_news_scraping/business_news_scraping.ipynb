       "['Chinas economic growth surged to 18.3 over a year ago in the first quarter of 2021 after factory and consumer activity returned largely to normal following the coronavirus pandemic.The figures reported Friday were magnified by comparison with early 2020, when the worlds secondlargest economy fell into its deepest contraction in decades. The government noted growth in activity compared with the final quarter of 2020, when a recovery already had begun, was a more modest 0.6.Manufacturing, auto sales and other consumer activity have revived to above prepandemic levels since the ruling Communist Party declared victory over the coronavirus last March and allowed factories and stores to reopen.The economy delivered a stable performance with a consolidated foundation and good momentum of growth, the National Bureau of Statistics said in a report.The outsize jump in the headline number was in line with expectations by forecasters due to the low basis for comparison in early 2020.Some warn that despite Chinas impressive recent performance, a recovery still is uncertain because global demand is weak as some governments reimpose antidisease curbs that disrupt business and trade.The economy shrank by 6.8 in the first quarter of last year as the ruling Communist Party took the thenunprecedented step of closing most factories, shops and offices to fight the outbreak that started in the central city of Wuhan in late 2019. It was Chinas worst performance since at least the mid1960s.Growth recovered to 6.5 over a year earlier in the final quarter following the economys relatively early reopening while the United States, Europe and Japan struggled with renewed disease outbreaks. China eked out fullyear growth of 2.3, becoming the only major economy to expand in 2020.Retail spending surged 33.9 in the first quarter over a year earlier, while factory output rose 24.5, according to the NBS. Investment in real estate, factories and other fixed assets rose 25.6.Chinese exports have benefited from demand for masks and other medical supplies while foreign competitors still face antivirus restrictions. Forecasters say that boost will pass as sales of medical supplies decline and other economies reopen.',\n",
       " 'Jeff Bezos, who founded Amazon as an online bookstore and built it into a shopping and entertainment behemoth, will step down later this year as CEO, a role hes had for nearly 30 years, to become executive chairman, the company announced Tuesday.Bezos, 57, will be replaced in the summer by Andy Jassy, who runs Amazons cloudcomputing business.In a blog post to employees, Bezos said he planned to focus on new products and early initiatives being developed at Amazon. He said he would have more time for side projects, including his space exploration company Blue Origin, his philanthropic initiatives and overseeing The Washington Post, which he owns.Bezos, who is the companys biggest shareholder, will still have broad influence over Amazon.Jeff is really not going anywhere, Amazons Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said in a call with reporters. Its more of a restructuring of whos doing what.Launched in 1995, Amazon was a pioneer of fast, free shipping that won over millions of shoppers who used the site to buy diapers, TVs and just about anything else. Under Bezos, Amazon also launched the first ereader that gained mass acceptance, and its Echo listening device made voice assistants a common sight in living rooms.As a child, Bezos was intrigued by computers and interested in building things, such as alarms he rigged in his parents home. He got a degree in electrical engineering and computer science at Princeton University, and then worked at several Wall Street companies.He quit his job at D.E. Shaw to start an online retail business  though at first he wasnt sure what to sell. Bezos quickly determined that an online bookstore would resonate with consumers. He and his now exwife, MacKenzie Scott, whom he met at D.E. Shaw and married in 1993, set out on a road trip to Seattle  a city chosen for its abundance of tech talent and proximity to a large book distributor in Roseburg, Oregon.While Scott drove, Bezos wrote up the business plan for what would become Amazon.com. Bezos convinced his parents and some friends to invest in the idea, and Amazon began operating out of the Bezos Seattle garage on July 16, 1995.Amazon has gone far beyond selling paperbacks. It now produces movies, makes sofas, owns a grocery chain and even has plans to send satellites into space to beam internet service to earth. The company is one of the most valuable in the world, worth nearly 1.7 trillion.During the pandemic, Amazon was one of the few retailers to benefit as shoppers stayed clear of malls and shopped from their phones. On the same day Amazon announced Bezos would step down, the company reported making a record profit in the last three months of 2020, and its quarterly revenue shot past 100 billion for the first time.Bezos riches have also swelled His stake in Amazon is currently worth about 180 billion. For years he stayed behind the scenes, running the company. More recently, he sometimes stepped into the spotlight, showing up at movie premieres and Hollywood parties.In 2019, he announced he was divorcing Scott in a tweet, just before the National Enquirer published a cover story saying Bezos had an affair with a former TV host. Scott received a stake in Amazon after the divorce worth nearly 40 billion at the time. She has pledged to give away half her fortune to charities.As Amazon has grown, so has scrutiny. Amazon and other tech giants have enjoyed lighttouch regulation and star status in Washington for decades, but calls for greater regulation are growing. A report by the House Judiciary Committee in October called for possibly breaking up Amazon and others, making it harder for them to acquire companies and imposing new rules to safeguard competition.Bezos is one of the last founders of a big tech company to still be CEO. The founders of Google, Oracle and Microsoft have all stepped down from the top job of the companies they created. Facebook is still led by cofounder Mark Zuckerberg.Jassy, Bezos replacement, is a longtime Amazon executive, having worked at the company since 1997. The cloudcomputing business he runs powers videostreaming site Netflix and many other companies, and it has become Amazons most profitable business.Hes deeply steeped in technology and a very seasoned executive in his own right, Gartner analyst Ed Anderson said.But he will also face many challenges.Amazons size makes some industries uncomfortable, some governments uncomfortable, and Andy Jassy will have to deal with the consequences, Anderson said. That will be some of the new era of his leadership.',\n",
       " 'Chinas highestprofile entrepreneur, Jack Ma, appeared Wednesday in an online video, ending a 2 1/2month absence from public view that prompted speculation about the future of the ecommerce billionaire and his Alibaba Group.In the 50second video, Ma congratulated teachers supported by his foundation and made no mention of his disappearance or official efforts to tighten control over Alibaba and other internet companies over the past six months. The video appeared on Chinese business news and other websites.The normally voluble Ma disappeared from public view after he irked regulators by criticizing them in an Oct. 24 speech at a Shanghai conference. Days later, regulators suspended the planned multibilliondollar stock market debut of Ant Group, a financial platform that grew out of Alibabas payments service, Alipay.That prompted speculation online about whether the 56yearold Ma, Chinas biggest global business celebrity and a symbol of its tech boom, had been detained or might face legal trouble. Alibaba and the government havent responded to questions about him.The Jack Ma Foundation said in a statement Wednesday Jack Ma participated in the online ceremony of the annual Rural Teacher Initiative event on January 20. The foundation and Alibaba didnt respond to questions about Mas status and when his next public event might be.President Xi Jinpings government says antimonopoly enforcement against internet companies will be a priority this year. Alibaba and other companies have been fined for violating antimonopoly rules. Some social media services have been reprimanded for lapses in enforcing censorship.In his October speech, Ma complained regulators had an antique pawnshop mentality and were hampering innovation, according to Chinese media. He appealed to them to make it easier for entrepreneurs and young people to borrow.That clashed with the ruling partys marathon campaign to reduce surging debt in Chinas financial system that prompted fears about a possible bank crisis and led rating agencies to cut Beijings credit rating for government borrowing.Some people suggested the ruling Communist Party was making an example of Ma to show entrepreneurs couldnt defy regulators. But finance experts said Xis government was uneasy about Alibabas dominance in retailing and Ants potential financial risks.Antimonopoly regulators warned executives Alibaba and five other tech giants in December not to use their dominance to block new competitors from entering their markets. The central bank and other regulators have ordered Ant to overhaul its business before its market debut can go ahead.Alibabas share price in Hong Kong is down 10 since October but recovered some of its loss from its low point this month.Ma, a ruling party member, stepped down as Alibaba chairman in 2019 but is a member of the Alibaba Partnership, a 36member group with the right to nominate a majority of the companys board of directors. He played a leading role in developing Ant, which grew out of Alibabas online payment service, Alipay.In the video Wednesday, Ma, wearing a blue sweater over a white T shirt and gray trousers, smiled and waved to viewers.

       " 'Boeing will pay 2.5 billion to settle a Justice Department investigation and admit that employees misled regulators about the safety of its 737 Max aircraft, which suffered two deadly crashes shortly after entering airline service.The government and the company said Thursday that the settlement includes money for the crash victims families, airline customers and a fine.Prosecutors said Boeing employees gave misleading statements and halftruths about safety issues with the plane to the Federal Aviation Administration, then covered up their actions.Boeings employees chose the path of profit over candor, said David Burns, acting assistant attorney general for the Justice Departments criminal division.Boeing blamed two former pilots who helped determine how much training was needed for the Max. CEO David Calhoun said their conduct doesnt reflect Boeing employees as a whole or the character of the company.This is a substantial settlement of a very serious matter, and I firmly believe that entering into this resolution is the right thing for us to do  a step that appropriately acknowledges how we fell short of our values and expectations, Calhoun said in a memo to employees.The government will drop the criminal charge of conspiracy to defraud the U.S. after three years if Boeing follows the terms of the settlement.The settlement removes uncertainty about criminal charges against the iconic U.S. aircraft maker, which is struggling to put the Max crisis behind it. Boeing still faces lawsuits by the families of passengers who died in the crashes, it has lost more than 1,000 orders for the Max, and its oncestellar reputation for engineering has suffered.Boeing began working on the Max in 2011 as an answer to a new, more fuelefficient model from European rival Airbus. Boeing admitted in court filings that two of its technical pilot experts deceived the FAA about a flightcontrol system called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS, that could point a planes nose down if sensors indicated the plane might be in danger of an aerodynamic stall  that it might fall from the sky.The system was not part of previous 737 models. MCAS was added because the Maxs larger engines, which are mounted higher and farther forward on the 737s lowswept wings, gave the plane a tendency to tilt too far noseup in some conditions.Boeing downplayed the significance of MCAS and didnt mention it in airplane manuals. Most pilots didnt know about it.The first airlines began flying the 737 Max in mid2017. On Oct. 29, 2018, a Max operated by Indonesias Lion Air plunged into the Java Sea. The FAA let the Max keep flying, and on March 10, 2019, another Max operated by Ethiopian Airlines crashed nearly straight down into a field. In all, 346 people were killed.On both flights, MCAS was activated by a faulty reading from a single sensor. The system repeatedly pushed the planes noses down, and pilots were unable to regain control.After the planes were grounded worldwide, Boeing changed MCAS so that it always uses two sensors, along with other changes to make the automated system less powerful and easier for pilots to override. The FAA ordered other changes, including the rerouting of some wiring to avoid potential dangerous shortcircuiting.In November, the FAA approved Boeings changes, and several carriers including American Airlines have resumed using the planes.Under the settlement announced Thursday, Boeing will pay a 243.6 million fine, 1.77 billion in compensation to airlines that were unable to use their Max jets while they were grounded, and 500 million into a fund for the families of passengers who were killed in the crashes.Boeing faces dozens of lawsuits by families who lost relatives in the crashes. Three lawyers pressing cases in the Ethiopian crash said the settlement would not affect their pursuit of compensation.Zipporah Kuria, a U.K. citizen whose father died in the Ethiopian crash, said that with the settlement, Boeing leaders were seeking to pay their way out of accountability. The agreement wont bring back our loved ones, but at least there is clarity that their deaths werent incidental and there is clarity in liability.House Transportation Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio, DOre, meanwhile, said the settlement amounted to a slap on the wrist for a company the size of Boeing.I hope the DOJ can explain its rationale for this weak settlement to the families, because from where I sit this attempt to change corporate behavior is pathetic and will do little to deter criminal behavior going forward, DeFazio said in a statement.Boeing said in a regulatory filing that it will take a 743.6 million charge against earnings because of the settlement.The crashes and grounding of the Max, Boeings bestselling plane, has plunged the Chicagobased company into its deepest crisis. It has led to billions in losses and resulted in the ouster of former CEO Dennis Muilenburg in December 2019.',\n",
       " 'American Airlines flew a Boeing 737 Max with paying passengers from Miami to New York on Tuesday, the planes first commercial flight in U.S. skies since it was grounded after two deadly crashes.American flight 718 carried 87 passengers on the 172seat plane, and the return flight from LaGuardia Airport to Miami International Airport held 151 passengers, according to an airline spokeswoman.Last month, the Federal Aviation Administration approved changes that Boeing made to an automated flightcontrol system implicated in crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that killed 346 people in all. In both crashes, the system pushed the nose down repeatedly based on faulty sensor readings, and pilots were unable to regain control.The FAA cleared the way for U.S. airlines to resume using the plane if certain changes are made and pilots are provided with additional training including time in a flight simulator.Brazils Gol airlines operated the first passenger flight with a revamped Max on Dec. 9. Since then, Gol and Aeromexico have operated about 600 flights between them with Max jets, according to tracking service Flightradar24 and aviationdata firm Cirium.American plans to make one round trip a day between Miami and New York with Max jets through Jan. 4 before putting the plane on more routes. United Airlines plans to resume Max flights in February, and Southwest Airlines expects to follow in March.All three airlines say they will give customers the chance to change flights if they are uncomfortable flying on the Max.The Max was grounded worldwide in March 2019, days after the second crash. Reports by House and Senate committees faulted Boeing and the FAA for failures in the process of certifying the plane. Congressional investigators uncovered internal Boeing documents in which company employees raised safety concerns and bragged about deceiving regulators.FAA Administrator Stephen Dickson, a former military and airline pilot, operated a test flight in September and vouched for the reworked planes safety, saying he would put his family on it. American Airlines President Robert Isom was on Tuesdays inaugural U.S. flight, according to the airline.Some relatives of people who died in the second crash, a Max operated by Ethiopian Airlines, contend that the plane is still unsafe. They and their lawyers say that Boeing is refusing to hand over documents about the planes design and development.The truth is that 346 people are now dead because Boeing cut corners, lied to regulators, and simply considers this the cost of doing business, Yalena LopezLewis, whose husband died in the crash, said in a statement issued by her lawyers. It is infuriating that American Airlines is in effect rewarding Boeing for the corrupt and catastrophic process that led to the Max.Zipporah Kuria, a British citizen whose father also died in the Ethiopian crash, pointed to the recent disclosure in a Senate committee report that Boeing representatives coached FAA test pilots reviewing Boeing updates to the Max flightcontrol system.Boeing leadership is still riddled with deceit. Their priorities are not on consumer safety, she said in an interview.Boeing spokesman Bernard Choi said the company learned many hard lessons from the crashes and is committed to safety.We continue to work closely with global regulators and our customers to support the safe return of the fleet to service around the world, Choi said.The return of the plane to U.S. skies is a huge boost for Boeing, which has lost billions during the Max grounding because it has been unable to deliver new planes to airline customers. Orders for the plane have plunged. Boeing has removed more than 1,000 Max jets from its backlog because airlines canceled orders or the sales are not certain to go through because of the pandemic crisis gripping the travel industry.',\n",
       " 'Chinese regulators have ordered Ant Group, the worlds largest financial technology company, to rectify its businesses and comply with regulatory requirements amid increased scrutiny of antimonopoly practices in the countrys internet sector.The Peoples Bank of China, the countrys central bank, summoned Ant executives on Saturday and ordered them to formulate a rectification plan and an implementation timetable of its business, including its credit, insurance and wealth management services, the regulators said in a statement Sunday.The statement said that Ant Group lacked a sound governance mechanism, defied regulatory compliance requirements and engaged in regulatory arbitrage. It also said that the company used its market position to exclude rivals and hurt the rights and interests of consumers.The meeting came after Chinese regulators last month halted Ants 37 billion stock debut in Shanghai and Hong Kong over regulatory changes, and comes just days after China announced an antimonopoly investigation of ecommerce giant Alibaba Group, which owns a 33 stake in Ant Group.The orders from regulators could limit Ant Groups expansion and throw its lucrative finance businesses into disarray.Ant Group, which started out as a payments services for Alibabas ecommerce platform Taobao, has since expanded to offer insurance and investment products to its hundreds of millions of users in mainland China. Jack Ma, the founder of both Alibaba and Ant Group, is one of Chinas richest and most prominent entrepreneurs.Regulators ordered Ant Group to establish a financial holding company and hold sufficient capital. They also said that Ant Group should return to its payments origins, enhance transparency around transactions and prohibit unfair competition, while improving corporate governance and ensuring that it complies with regulatory requirements for its businesses.Ant Group said in a statement Sunday that it would comply with regulatory requirements and enhance risk management and control, and that a working group would be set up to make the necessary rectifications.We appreciate financial regulators guidance and help, the statement said. The rectification is an opportunity for Ant Group to strengthen the foundation for our business to grow with full compliance, and to continue focusing on innovating for social good and serving small businesses.The scrutiny of Ant Group and Alibaba comes as China closely examines the influence of the countrys internet sector.Last month, China released draft regulations to clamp down on anticompetitive practices in the industry, such as signing exclusive agreements with merchants and the use of subsidies to squeeze out competitors.Alibaba and a company spun off by Tencent Holding Ltd. were fined this month for failing to apply for official approval before proceeding with some acquisitions.Last Tuesday, regulators met with executives of Alibaba and five other major Chinese internet companies and warned them not to abuse their dominance to drive out competitors through use of exclusive contracts, predatory pricing and other tactics, according to a statement by the State Administration of Market Regulation.',\n",
       " 'Chinese consumers are expected to spend tens of billions on everything from fresh food to luxury goods during this years Singles Day online shopping festival, as the country recovers from the pandemic.The shopping festival, which is the worlds largest and falls on Nov. 11 every year, is an annual extravaganza where Chinas ecommerce companies, including Alibaba, JD.com and Pinduoduo, offer generous discounts on their platforms. Last year, shoppers spent 38.4 billion on Alibabas ecommerce platforms Tmall and Taobao.The shopping festival got its name as it falls on Nov. 11 every year. Also known as 11.11 or Double 11, the numbers look like bare branches, an expression referring to those who are single and unattached in China. The day thus later became known as Singles Day.This years festival will be closely watched as a barometer of consumption in China, which is just beginning to bounce back from the coronavirus pandemic after months of lockdown earlier in the year.Analysts expect Chinese consumers to spend more on imported products and foreign luxury brands, since many Chinese tourists were unable to travel internationally due to the coronavirus pandemic and tightened travel restrictions.A survey by consulting firm Oliver Wyman found that 86 of Chinese consumers are willing to spend the same as or more than during last years Singles Day festival.In the last six months or so, wealthy households have actually spent more money, said Sean Shen, customer and strategy competence leader for EY in Greater China. We also see that purchases of luxury segment products are increasing because of the international travel restrictions.In 2018, Chinese consumers spent about 770 billion yuan (116.3 billion) on luxury items, accounting for about a third of the global spend, with each luxuryconsuming household spending an average of 80,000 yuan annually (12,089), according to a 2019 McKinsey report on luxury.Sales of electronic goods and health and wellness products are also expected to rise, as more people work from home and pay more attention to their health amid the pandemic, according to a report by consultancy Bain  Company.To help merchants cope with the impact from the coronavirus, online platforms have extended the shopping festival period this year in hopes of boosting sales.Both Alibaba and JD.com, the countrys two biggest ecommerce companies, began offering discounts on Oct. 21, three weeks ahead of Nov. 11. Some brands and merchants that slashed their prices booked hundreds of millions of yuan (tens of millions of dollars) in sales just hours into the shopping festival.Tang Chenghui, an electrical engineer who lives in Beijing sees Singles Day as an opportunity to stock up on snacks and imported products such as milk from Australia. Ahead of the festival, Tang preordered 3 boxes of duck eggs, 10 packets of soybean milk powder, two boxes of yogurt, coffee and wine.Im buying more snacks this year because Ive just moved into a new apartment and have enough storage space to stockpile the snacks I like, said Tang. Some of these products are really cheap during the Singles Day discounts.Unlike Black Friday and Cyber Monday in the U.S., Singles Day in China is not just about deep bargains. Alibaba pioneered the concept of Singles Day and holds an annual gala on Nov. 11 with celebrity performances to entertain shoppers.Ecommerce companies dont break down Singles Day sales volume by brands so it is hard to know what share goes to foreign companies, though some companies might announce their own performances.Sales via livestreaming and Alibabas annual gala are part of a shoppertainment trend which blends shopping with entertainment in order to become more appealing and engaging to shoppers.Mini games within online shopping platforms entice shoppers with deeper discounts while encouraging them to spend more time within the app.Because of COVID19, brands and retailers have doubled down on ecommerce and livestreaming commerce to drive growth, and it will show strongly on (Singles Day) this year, said Wang Xiaofeng, a senior analyst at Forrester.But while millions of shoppers spend hours on mini games hoping to snag better bargains, some are irked by the complexities required to win such discounts.Black Friday discounts tend to be better, and they are more straightforward, said Liu Zhirou, a 27 yearold Beijingbased accountant. Now, I still ask my friends to help me buy things from the U.S. during Black Friday.The rules around Singles Day discounts now are getting more and more complicated, she said. I usually just spend my money on Black Friday, and buy less on Singles Day.',\n",

Imports rose 4.7 by value to 178.7 billion, decelerating from the previous months 13.2 surge, though volumes of some goods increased.Chinas exporters have benefited from the relatively early reopening of the secondlargest global economy and demand for masks and other medical supplies. That has allowed them to take market share from foreign competitors that are hampered by antidisease controls.Exports for the first 10 months of 2020 rose 0.5 over the same period a year earlier to 2 trillion, the first positive yeartodate figure. Exports have been bigger than the same month a year earlier since April, but after the first quarters 13.3 contraction, total growth for 2020 was in negative territory until now.In October, exports to the United States in October gained 22.5 over a year ago to 43.8 billion, up from the previous months 20.5 growth. Imports of American goods jumped 33.4 to 12.5 billion, an increase from Septembers 24.5 growth.Chinas monthly global trade surplus swelled 35.8 over a year earlier to 58.4 billion, one of its biggest on record.The politically sensitive trade gap with the United States expanded 18.5 to 31.4 billion.China is on track to become the only major economy to grow this year while activity in the United States, Europe and Japan shrinks.Chinas economy shrank by 6.8 from a year earlier in the first three months of 2020 after factories, shops and offices were shut down to fight the virus. Growth rebounded to 3.2 in the second quarter and accelerated to 4.9 in the three months ending in September.Automakers and other large manufacturers are back to normal activity, helping to drive demand for imported iron ore, copper and other industrial materials. Retail sales have rebounded to above previrus levels, rising 0.5 over a year earlier in the quarter ending in September.Imports have fallen by value after weak demand caused prices of oil and other commodities to plunge. But volumes of foreign food and other goods bought by Chinese factories and consumers have risen.Imports of crude oil rose 10.6 by volume over a year earlier in the first nine months of 2020 but fell 24.5 by value, according to customs data. Grain imports rose 28.5 by volume but only 21 by value.Exports to the 27nation European Union fell 21 in October to 22.7 billion. Imports of European goods sank 20.4 to 33.6 billion.

Debuting at No. 3 was Zhong Shanshan, chairman of bottled water brand Nongfu Spring, with 53.7 billion following his companys Hong Kong stock market debut in September.Rising share prices created an average of five new Chinese entrepreneurs worth at least 1 billion every week over the past year, according to Huruns founder, Rupert Hoogewerf.The world has never seen this much wealth created in just one year, said Hoogewerf in a statement. Chinas entrepreneurs have done much better than expected. Despite Covid19 they have risen to record levels.The richest woman on the list was Yang Huiyan of real estate developer Country Garden. She was No. 6 at 33 billion, up 29 from last year.Rankings of Chinas richest change abruptly from year to year as real estate, technology and other industries rise and fall in the fastevolving economy.This year, the coronavirus boosted the fortunes of Alibabas Ma and other internet entrepreneurs as the shutdown of the Chinese economy to fight the virus propelled demand for online shopping and business tools.Eric Yuan of Californiabased video conference platform Zoom rose more than 10 billion to 16.2 billion. Li Yongxin of Offcn, an online work training platform, more than doubled to 20.6 billion. Chen Xiangdong of tutoring platform Genshuixue rose eightfold to 11.8 billion.Ma, 56, retired as Alibaba chairman last year and also is a shareholder in Ant Group, a payments service spun off from Alibaba.

       " 'The owner of TikTok has chosen Oracle over Microsoft as the American tech partner that could help keep the popular videosharing app running in the U.S., according to a source familiar with the deal who was not authorized to speak publicly about it.Microsoft announced Sunday that its bid to acquire TikToks U.S. operations was rejected, removing the tech giant from the running a week before President Donald Trump promises to follow through with a plan to ban the Chineseowned app in the U.S. over spying concerns.TikTok and the White House declined to comment Sunday. Oracle didnt return a request for comment but has previously declined comment.Walmart, which had planned to partner with Microsoft on the acquisition, said Sunday it continues to have an interest in a TikTok investment and is talking about it with ByteDance and other parties.The Trump administration has threatened to ban TikTok by Sept. 20 and ordered ByteDance to sell its U.S. business, claiming nationalsecurity risks due to its Chinese ownership. The government worries about user data being funneled to Chinese authorities. TikTok denies it is a nationalsecurity risk and is suing to stop the administration from the threatened ban.Its not clear if the proposed deal will only cover TikToks U.S. business, and, if so, how it will be split from the rest of TikToks social media platform, which is popular worldwide. ByteDance also owns a similar video app, Douyin, for the Chinese market.Any deal must still be reviewed by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS, a U.S. government group chaired by the Treasury Secretary that studies mergers for nationalsecurity reasons. The president can approve or deny a transaction recommended by the panel, though Trump has already voiced support for Oracle as a great company that could handle the acquisition.Microsoft said in a Sunday statement that ByteDance let us know today they would not be selling TikToks US operations to Microsoft.Microsoft added it was confident our proposal would have been good for TikToks users, while protecting national security interests. The company said it would have made significant changes to ensure the service met the highest standards for security, privacy, online safety, and combating disinformation.TikTok, which says it has 100 million U.S. users and about 700 million globally, is known for its fun, goofy videos of dancing, lipsyncing, pranks and jokes. Its recently become home to more political content such as the comedian Sarah Cooper, who drew a large audience by lipsyncing Trumps own oftendisjointed statements from public appearances.But the app has also raised concerns because of its Chinese ownership. The White House has cracked down on a range of Chinese businesses, including telecom equipment makers Huawei and ZTE and messaging app WeChat, over worries that they would enable Chinese authorities to get U.S. user data. Republican and Democratic lawmakers have raised concerns about censorship and childrens privacy.TikTok denies that it has shared user data with the Chinese government or that it would do so if asked. The company says it has not censored videos at the request of Chinese authorities and insists it is not a nationalsecurity threat.TikTok has sued to stop the ban, but not the sale order. The negotiations have been complicated by several factors, including Trumps repeated demands that the U.S. government should get a cut of any deal, a stipulation and role for the president that experts say is unprecedented.In addition, the Chinese government in late August unveiled new regulations that restrict exports of technology, likely including the artificial intelligence system TikTok uses to choose which videos to spool up to its users. That means ByteDance would have to obtain a license from China to export such technology to a foreign company.The deal had come together rapidly after the administration ramped up its threats against TikTok this summer, despite TikToks efforts to put distance between its app and its Chinese ownership. It installed former Disney executive Kevin Mayer as its American CEO, but he resigned in August after just a few months on the job, saying the political environment has sharply changed.Both Microsoft and Oracle are known more for their business software offerings than for those intended for consumers.Oracle primarily makes database software. It competes with tech giants such as Microsoft and Amazon that provide cloud services as well as businesssoftware specialists like Salesforce.Some analysts see Oracles interest in a consumer business as misguided. Oracle should focus on enterprisemarket acquisitions and not invest in a consumer app like TikTok that doesnt fit with the rest of its business, said Jefferies analyst Brent Thill, who compares the idea to Delta Airlines buying a motorcycle company. It doesnt make any sense, he said.Thill suggested that TikTok competitors like Facebook and Snapchat should be cheering on Oracle as a buyer, because Oracle wouldnt add a lot of value to the app.Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison is unusual among tech executives for his public support of President Donald Trump, hosting a fundraiser for him in February at his Rancho Mirage, California, estate. The company also hired a former top aide to Vice President Mike Pence its CEO, Safra Catz, also served on Trumps transition team.The president said on Aug. 18 that Oracle was a great company that could handle buying TikTok. He declined to state his preference between Oracle and Microsoft as buyers.',\n",

We have saved Rs 2 per liter while bringing it by the pipeline,\" NOC Spokesperson Binit Mani Upadhyaya said as the NOC marked a year of bringing oil by the pipeline on Wednesday.He revealed that the country imported 534,103,000 liters in the past one year and there was a saving of Rs 1,068,206,000 at the rate of Rs 2 every liter.Chief of the Amlekhgunj Depot of NOC Bharat Regmi said even the quantity of import has increased in the last year.The depots in Bhairahawa, Amlekhgunj and Biratnagar earlier used to separately bring petroleum products in tankers themselves. The oil for the whole country now comes to Amlekhgunj through the pipeline. Regmi said bringing oil through the pipeline instead of tankers also reduces pollution due to lack of emission by the tankers. Prime ministers (PM) of Nepal and India had inaugurated the MotihariAmlekhgunj petroleum pipeline from their respective residences last year. PM KP Sharma Oli and his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi had inaugurated the pipeline by simultaneously pushing the buttons from Kathmandu and New Delhi respectively.

       " 'Pakistan is seeking the reversal of a 5.8 billion penalty imposed by an international tribunal for denying a mining lease to an Australian company, saying that paying the fine would hinder its handling of the coronavirus pandemic.The Reko Diq district in southwestern Pakistans Baluchistan province is famed for its mineral wealth, including gold and copper. Prime Minister Imran Khans government considers it a strategic national asset, though instead of yielding a bonanza the Reko Diq mining project may cost the country dearly.The World Banks International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes is considering Pakistans appeal against enforcing the penalty over its cancellation of the Reko Diq mining lease for Tethyan Copper Corp., a 5050 joint venture of Barrick Gold Corp. of Australia and Antofagasto PLC of Chile.In the meantime, the Baluchistan government has set up its own company to develop the mine As prices for commodities surge, with gold recently at more than 2,000 an ounce, turning fiasco to fortune is all the more appealing.Pakistan and Tethyan both have signaled a willingness to discuss alternative solutions, such as a settlement, but the status of any talks on a deal is unclear. Officials on the Pakistan side said they have not been in direct contact and no specific settlement has been proposed.Despite the initiation of arbitral proceedings in order to protect its rights, TCC remains hopeful of an opportunity to reach a negotiated resolution to the case, says a statement on the companys website issued after the 2019 arbitration ruling.Asked recently, Tethyan officials said there were no updates.An official in Pakistans attorney generals office said an out of court settlement with Tethyan Copper Corp. , or TCC, was possible pending a final decision on the award, which might not come until next year.The Reko Diq case is testing Khans ability to use back channel diplomacy to settle disputes and keep alive efforts to lure more foreign investors.According to details available on Tethyans website, the Reko Diq Mining Project was to build and operate a world class coppergold openpit mine at a cost of about 3.3 billion. The project could be a beacon for further investment into exploration and mining sectors in Baluchistan and Pakistan in general, the company said.Tethyan says its 1998 agreement with the local Baluchistan government entitled it to the mining lease, subject only to routine government requirements.After an extensive and detailed feasibility study, the companys local subsidiary submitted a mining lease application in 2011. The project stalled in November 2011 when the Baluchistan provincial government rejected the application.Pakistani officials in both Islamabad, the capital, and Baluchistan say the mining lease was terminated by the Baluchistan government because it was secured in a nontransparent manner and granted too many concessions to the company, violating government rules and regulations and ignoring national interests.By then, Tethyan had invested 220 million in Reko Diq. The Australian mining company sought help from the World Bank arbitration tribunal in 2012, and it ruled against Pakistan in 2017, rejecting an earlier decision against Tethyan by the Pakistan Supreme Court.The miner originally sought 8.5 billion. The tribunal opted to use a formula for calculating damages for the cancelled lease based on the assumed profits Tethyan might have earned from the mine over 56 years, said an official at the Justice Ministry who spoke on condition he not be named because he was not authorized to speak to media about the case.The resulting fine, of nearly 6 billion including the damages award and interest, is equal to about 2 of Pakistans GDP and is on a par with a recently agreed upon bailout package for Pakistan from the International Monetary Fund.Economist Jeffrey Sachs described it as a mugging of Pakistan. Other experts also have questioned the reasoning behind huge award, which is more than double the size of the largest similar arbitration award, in the case between Dow Chemical and Kuwait Petrochemical Corp.Documents explaining the award suggest one intention was to penalize Pakistan for having violated its investment treaty with Australia.Regardless, paying compensation equivalent to 40 of the countrys foreign exchange reserves would be a challenge as the impoverished Islamic nation struggles to revive its economy. The pandemic has infected nearly 300,000 of Pakistans 212 million people and killed more than 6,300, while the economy contracted for the first time in decades in the fiscal year that ended in June.Reko Diqs proximity to the Saindak copper mine operated by Minmetals Corp. of China has raised speculation that Pakistan might tap help from Beijing in resolving the problem if its latest effort to get the award revoked fails.Baluchistans Gwardar port is an anchor in the China Pakistan Economic Corridor, part of Beijings vast Belt and Road infrastructure initiative.Minmetals chairman, Guo Wenqing, met with Khan, the prime minister, in Beijing last year. But both Pakistani officials involved in the Reko Diq project and Minmentals said there is no discussion of a bailout by China.Mahfooz Ali Khan, who retired as finance secretary in Baluchistan province, told The AP the regional government initially agreed to the project hoping to see the mine developed but cancelled after it found rules had been violated.I personally feel that both sides should consider an out of court settlement as both sides have solid legal points to continue a legal battle, but it would be better if they renegotiate and resume work on the project, he said.',\n",
       " 'Zoom Video Communications is rapidly emerging as the latest internet gold mine as millions of people flock to its conferencing service to see colleagues, friends and family while tethered to their homes during the pandemic.Tuesdays release of the onceobscure companys financial results for the FebruaryApril period provided a window into the astronomical growth that has turned it into a Wall Street star.Zooms revenue for its fiscal firstquarter more than doubled from the same time last year to 328 million, resulting a profit of 27 million  up from just 198,000 a year ago.The numbers exceeded analysts already heightened expectations, providing another lift to a rocketing stock that has more than tripled in price so far this year while the benchmark Standard  Poors 500 index has fallen 5.After a big runup leading up to Tuesdays highly anticipated announcement, Zooms stock initially rose even higher in extended trading. But it abruptly reversed course and fell more than 3 after company executives acknowledged during a video discussion that some of its newfound users might depart during the second half of the year if health worries caused by the novel corornavirus dissipate.Even if the shares trade in similar fashion during Wednesdays regular session, the stock will still be hovering around 200  more than five times the companys initial public offering price of 36 less than 14 months ago.The surge left Zoom with a market value of about 59 billion through Tuesday  greater than the combined market values of the four largest U.S. airlines, which have seen their businesses hammered by the coronavirus outbreak that has dramatically curtailed travel.Videoconferencing is going to become a mainstream service, predicted Zoom CEO Eric Yuan, who cofounded the company nine years ago. He made the remarks during the video conference that at one point attracted more than 3,000 participants, a reflection of the intense interest in the company and its hot stock.In a sign that the company still expects phenomenal growth in the months ahead, Zoom forecast revenue of roughly 500 million for its current quarter ending in July, more than quadrupling from the same time last year. For its full fiscal year, Zoom now expects revenue of about 1.8 billion, nearly tripling in a year.Zooms boom has come despite privacy and security problems that enabled outsiders to make uninvited  and sometimes crude  appearances during other peoples video conferences.The concerns prompted some schools to stop using Zoom for online classes that have become widespread since February, although the companys efforts to introduce more security protection has brought some back to the service. More than 100,000 schools worldwide are now using Zoom for online classes, according to the company.Overall, Zoom now has more than 300 million daily participants attending a meeting held on its service, up from 10 million five months ago. Those numbers include people who join multiple Zoom meetings during the same day, something that has been happening more recently in recent months.But the onceweak privacy controls also helped make Zoom extremely easy to use, one of the reasons it became such a popular way to hold online classes, business meetings and virtual cocktail hours after most of the U.S. began ordering people to stay at home in effort to reduce the spread of the coronavirus that causes COVID19.Zoom also offers a free version of its service, another factor in its popularity at a time when about 40 million people in the U.S. have lost their jobs since midMarch, raising the specter of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s.The San Jose, California, company has always made most of its money from companies that subscribe to a more sophisticated version of its service that traditionally has been used for business meetings among employees working in offices far apart from each other.But the pandemicdriven shutdown turned Zoom into a tool for employees who once worked alongside each other, but have been doing their jobs from home during the past few months.Zoom ended April with 265,400 corporate customers with at least 10 employees, more than quadrupling from the same time last year. About 30 of the companys revenue in the most recent quarter came from users with fewer than 10 employees, up from 20 in the NovemberJanuary period.Although Zoom remains focused on servicing its corporate customers, Yuan is hoping to figure out ways to make money from the all the socializing and learning that is happening on the service, too. Some analysts have speculated that eventually may involve showing ads on the free version of Zoom, although the company hasnt given any indication it will do that. There are a lot of opportunities ahead of us, Yuan said in Tuesdays video conference without elaborating.If it hopes to continue to expand, Zoom also will also will likely have to do a better job of protecting the privacy of its video conferences. To help achieve that goal, Yuan has been consulting since April with Alex Stamos, a highly respected online security expert who previously worked at Yahoo and Facebook. Both those companies encountered their only security and privacy problems, too.Zooms success is also drawing stiffer competition from much larger companies, including Microsoft, Google and Facebook.',\n",
       " 'China, the worlds biggest energy consumer, is building up stockpiles of crude oil as global prices plunge due to the coronavirus outbreak.Imports rose 4.5 in March over a year earlier even as the worlds secondlargest economy shut down to fight the virus and demand collapsed. For the first quarter of the year imports were up 5.The price collapse is battering stateowned oil producers and possibly disrupting official plans to develop the industry but is a boon to Chinese drivers and factories. It gives Beijing a chance to add to a strategic petroleum reserve that is meant to insulate the country against possible supply disruptions.In the midst of all this, China oil imports have been resilient, as low prices have enabled stockpiling, said Peter Lee, senior oil and gas analyst for Fitch Solutions.As global prices fell, Chinese importers sent 84 tankers to Saudi Arabia in midMarch, each able to carry 2 million barrels of crude, according to news reports that cited the China Shipbuilding Industry Association.Low oil prices have a positive impact on China, said the ruling Communist Partys Political and Legal Commission on its social media account.Still, the plunge threatens to disrupt plans to make China more energy selfreliant if stateowned drillers have to cut spending on developing domestic oilfields, said industry analyst Max Petrov of Wood Mackenzie.Stateowned PetroChina Ltd., Asias biggest producer, is probably losing quite serious amounts of money, said Petrov. He said PetroChina has to decide whether to follow the lead of Western producers and slash spending on new wells.If it cuts investment, and because of the nature of Chinas oilfields, it will take a very long time for production to come back up, said Petrov. It will take years and even more money.Beijing also appears to be adding to its strategic stockpile, though details are secret.The Cabinets National Energy Administration reported in September that total reserves held by the government and oil companies were equal to 80 days of consumption.The official reserve stands at about 385 million barrels, according to Lee of Fitch Solutions. He said plans appear to call for increasing that to 500 to 600 million barrels.If enough additional storage capacity is built, the government might import 500,000 to 900,000 barrels per day for the strategic reserve, or 5 to 9 of Chinas total foreign purchases, according to Lee.The government reserve uses three tank farms and state media say a fourth might be under construction.The energy administration referred questions to the Cabinets planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission. The NDRC didnt respond Wednesday.The Communist Party commission said the plunge in prices gives Beijing a unique chance to build up that reserve but gave no indication the government was doing that.This is a onceacentury opportunity! the commission said.That might be hard to do, because like other countries China is running out of empty storage capacity, said Lei Sun of Wood Mackenzie.The strategic reserve and private suppliers had filled up at least 85 percent of their total storage capacity by February and added more oil in March, according to Lei. He said space that is left might be filled up with crude bought earlier at higher prices that Chinese buyers are forced to accept even though they had no customers.I dont think there is going to be any leftover space for crude, said Lei.Cheaper crude is one of Chinas few economic bright spots in the coronavirus pandemic.The economy suffered its worst contraction since the mid60s in the first quarter, shrinking 6.8 from a year earlier after Beijing closed factories and told some 800 million people to stay home.Forecasters expect little to no growth this year, down from 2019s 6.1, which already was a multidecade low.That is politically risky for the ruling party, which bases its claim to power on associating itself with Chinas economic success.Chinas two other major stateowned oil companies  Sinopec Ltd. and CNOOC  also are believed to be considering cuts in investment.China has relied increasingly on imported oil and gas since the late 1990s as manufacturing, car ownership and airline travel boomed.Imports make up about half of consumption. Half of that comes from the Middle East and the rest from Russia, Southeast Asia and Africa.The ruling party wants to curb that reliance, which communist leaders see as a security risk. That is a major factor behind Beijings multibilliondollar investments in hydro, wind and solar power.',\n",
       " 'The world is awash in oil, theres little demand for it and were running out of places to put it.That in a nutshell explains Mondays strange and unprecedented action in the market for crude oil futures contracts, where traders essentially offered to pay someone else to deal with the oil they were due to have delivered next month.The price of U.S. benchmark crude that would be delivered in May was selling for around 15 a barrel Monday morning, but fell as low as 40 per barrel during the day. It was the first time that the price on a futures contract for oil has gone negative, analysts say.Its the worst oil price in history, which shouldnt surprise us, because its the inevitable result of the biggest supply and demand disparity in history, said Ryan Sitton, commissioner at the Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates the states oil industry.Theres little mystery as to why theres so little demand for oil Efforts to limit the spread of the coronavirus have major cities around the world on lockdown, air travel has been seriously curtailed, and millions of people are working from home, leading to far fewer commuters on the roads.But pumps are still running, extracting oil from the ground, and all that oil has to go somewhere. Here are some questions and answers about the latest developments in the oil patchHAS THE PRICE OF OIL EVER GONE NEGATIVE BEFORESometimes, the price on the future delivery of oil will get skewed by a surprise event, say an oil pipeline bursts. That can cause the price of a futures contract for a given month to be sharply higher or lower than that of the futures contract for the next month.Usually, this is smoothed out by the market, but the sharp pullback in demand combined with a glut of oil has led to a dearth of oil storage capacity. That made it hard for traders with contracts for crude delivery in May to find buyers, which sent the contract price into negative territory.This has never happened before, not even close, said Tim Bray, senior portfolio manager at GuideStone Capital Management in Dallas. Weve never seen a negative price on a futures contract for oil.ARE OIL COMPANIES PAYING PEOPLE TO TAKE AWAY THEIR CRUDEWhile some companies may be paying others to take away their crude oil, that does not appear to be widespread.Many analysts described the dip in crude oil prices as technical, related to the way futures contracts are written. Most buyers are currently purchasing oil that would be delivered in June, not May.Even so, there were more than 150,000 of those futures contracts that traded hands, enough volume to make it meaningful, said Ryan Fitzmaurice, energy strategist at Rabobank.In my view, todays move was more technical in nature and related to the futures contract expiration, Fitzmaurice said. We could see isolated incidents where oil companies pay people to take their oil away as storage and pipeline capacity become scarce but that is unlikely on a sustained basis.WHATS GOING ON WITH OIL STORAGEWith far less gasoline and jet fuel being consumed, oil tanks are starting to fill up. Experts have been warning that global storage could fill up in late April or early May.Thats led some producers to decide to move oil now, because the space may become more valuable than the oil, Sitton said.Theres so much oversupply, and storage is fulling up, Sitton said. Eventually you go to a point where literally theres so much of a valuable commodity in the world that the commodity no longer has value. And thats what were seeing.WHERE WILL THE OIL GOWith many oil tanks filling up, the federal government is negotiating with companies to store crude oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. But if all the storage tanks are full, oil companies will begin shutting in wells, which can damage oil fields. Many tankers are full of oil and floating at sea.WHY DIDNT THE OPEC DEAL FIX THISEarlier this month, OPEC and its allies, with political pressure from the U.S. government, agreed to cut production by nearly 10 million barrels per day  about 10 of current global output. But some analysts feel the deal didnt go far enough to curb massive oversupply. It kept prices from falling farther for the time being, but theres still too much oil in the world.HOW WILL THIS AFFECT THE PRICE OF GASOLINECheap oil leads to cheaper prices at the pump, which are often viewed as a boon for consumers. The average price in the U.S. for a gallon of regular gasoline fell to about 1.49 or less, more than 1 less than a year ago, according to AAA. But this time around, its not good for anybody, said Jim Burkhard, vice president at IHS Markit.Typically when oil prices fall, gasoline prices fall and that benefits consumers, Burkhard said. But prices are falling today because hardly anyone driving, theyre driving a lot, lot less. So its difficult for anyone to take advantage of these lower gasoline prices if theyre not driving. So theres no winner in this situation today. ',\n",
       " 'OPEC, Russia and other oilproducing nations on Sunday finalized an unprecedented production cut of nearly 10 million barrels, or a tenth of global supply, in hopes of boosting crashing prices amid the coronavirus pandemic and a price war, officials said.This could be the largest reduction in production from OPEC for perhaps a decade, maybe longer, said U.S. Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette, who credited President Donald Trumps personal involvement in getting dueling parties to the table and helping to end a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia.Oil prices have collapsed as the coronavirus and the COVID19 illness it causes have largely halted global travel and slowed down other energychugging sectors such as manufacturing. It has devastated the oil industry in the U.S., which now pumps more crude than any other country.But some producers have been reluctant to ease supply. The cartel and other nations on Sunday agreed to allow Mexico to cut only 100,000 barrels a month, a sticking point for an accord initially reached Friday after a marathon video conference between 23 nations. The nations together agreed to cut 9.7 million barrels a day throughout May and June.The group reached the deal just hours before Asian markets reopened Monday and as international benchmark Brent crude traded at just over 31 a barrel and American shale producers struggle.Video aired by the Saudiowned satellite channel AlArabiya showed the moment that Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, a son of King Salman, assented to the deal.I go with the consent, so I agree, the prince said, chuckling, drawing a round of applause from those on the video call.But it had not been smiles and laughs for weeks after the socalled OPEC+ group of OPEC members and other nations failed in March to reach an agreement on production cuts, sending prices tumbling. Saudi Arabia sharply criticized Russia days earlier over what it described as comments critical of the kingdom, which finds itself trying to appease Trump, a longtime OPEC critic.Even U.S. senators had warned Saudi Arabia to find a way to boost prices as American shale firms face farhigher production costs. American troops had been deployed to the kingdom for the first time since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks over concerns of Iranian retaliation amid regional tensions.Theyve spent over the last month waging war on American oil producers while we are defending theirs. This is not how friends treat friends, said Sen. Kevin Cramer, a Republican from North Dakota, before the OPEC+ deal.U.S. producers have already been reducing output. The American Petroleum Institute lauded Sundays global pact, saying it will help get other nations stateowned oil production to follow the lead of U.S. producers that are trying to adjust to plunging demand.Brouillette said the U.S. did not make commitments of its own production cuts, but was able to show the obvious  that plunging demand because of the pandemic is expected to slash U.S. oil production.Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh also told state television that Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates would cut another 2 million barrels of oil a day between them atop the OPEC+ deal. The three countries did not immediately acknowledge the cut themselves, though Zanganeh attended the video conference.Officials said other planned cuts would stand in the deal, meaning an 8 million barrel per day cut from July through the end of the year and a 6 million barrel cut for 16 months beginning in 2021.This will enable the rebalancing of the oil markets and the expected rebound of prices by 15 per barrel in the short term, said a statement from Nigerias oil ministry.Mexico had initially blocked the deal but its president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, had said Friday that he had agreed with Trump that the U.S. will compensate what Mexico cannot add to the proposed cuts.The big Oil Deal with OPEC Plus is done. This will save hundreds of thousands of energy jobs in the United States, Trump said in a tweet. I would like to thank and congratulate President Putin of Russia and King Salman of Saudi Arabia.The Kremlin said President Vladimir Putin held a joint call with Trump and Saudi King Salman to express support of the deal. It also said Putin spoke separately with Trump about the oil market and other issues.Analysts offered cautious praise.The pure size of the cut is unprecedented, but, then again, so is the impact the coronavirus is having on demand, said Mohammed Ghulam, an energy analyst at Raymond James.But Ghulam and others worried it may not be enough.This is at least a temporary relief for the energy industry and for the global economy. This industry is too big to be let to fail and the alliance showed responsibility with this agreement, said Per Magnus Nysveen, the head of analysis at Rystad Energy. Even though the production cuts are smaller than what the market needed and only postpone the stock building constraints problem, the worst is for now avoided.',\n",
       " 'Telecom service provider Ncell has cleared all the capital gain tax on its sale on Sunday.It has paid Rs 14.33 billion on Friday, according to the Large Taxpayers Office. \"We are still in bank. Payment is being made. Ncell has paid Rs 14.33 billion,\" Chief Tax Administrator at the office Jhalak Ram Adhikari told Setopati.SwedishFinnish company TeliaSonera had not paid capital gain tax for sale of its 80 stake in Ncell to Malaysian company Axiata in April 2015.The Large Taxpayers Office earlier had determined that TeliaSonera had made capital gain of Rs 143.65 billion during the sale.The extended full bench of Supreme Court (SC) headed by Cholendra Shumsher Rana on February 6, 2019 had ordered that the capital gain tax be recovered from Ncell and Axiata. The full bench including Justices Meera Khadka, Bishwambhar Shrestha, Ananda Mohan Bhattarai and Tanka Moktan hearing a petition filed by Dwarika Nath Dhungel demanding the capital gain tax be recovered from Ncell on February 6 had issued a mandamus ruling that Ncell and Axiata should pay the tax.The mandamus reasoned that Ncell has to pay capital gain tax to the Nepal government despite TeliaSonera selling the shares to Axiata as its business is based in Nepal.The Large Taxpayers Office on April 16, 2019 had determined that Ncell must pay Rs 62.63 billion in capital gain tax including interest and late fine, and stated that Ncell need to pay Rs 39.06 billion more.Ncell, that had already deposited Rs 23.57 billion in two installments, then moved the SC claiming that it should pay only Rs 14.365 billion more. It had pointed that the SC has just ordered to recover capital gain tax, and not interest and late fine. It added that it should pay 25 percent of the capital gain of Rs 143.65 billion during the sale which comes out at Rs 35.91 billion.A full bench of Justices Tej Bahadur KC, Purushottam Bhandari, Dambar Bahadur Shahi, Sushma Lata Mathema and Manoj Kumar Sharma on August 26, 2019 had ordered that the fine component on the determined amount should not be recovered from Ncell.The SC had also revoked the writ petition filed by Ncell against the Large Taxpayers Office. \"The amount determined by the Large Taxpayers Office on April 16 has been revoked so far as the fee levied on the applicant as per clause 120(a) as it seems to be against the clause since the tax liability on Axiata Ncell was created only after the court imposed the liability of capital gain tax on Axiata Ncell and ruled that it should be recovered from the company. The claims of the applicant on other issues, apart from that, has been revoked,\" the SC verdict on August 26 stated.The SC on November 21, 2019 then calculated the revoked late fine component of the capital gain tax determined by the Large Taxpayers Office to be Rs 17,956,713,000, and stated that Ncell should only pay Rs 21,103,971,000 more.Ncell then paid Rs 4.50 billion on December 31, 2019 and Rs 4.60 billion on March 31. It has cleared all the outstanding capital gain tax including interest with payment of Rs 14.33 billion on Sunday.Malaysian company Axiata had bought Reynolds Holding, which held a majority stake in Ncell, from the SwedishFinnish company TeliaSonera in April 2016.Reynolds Holding was TeliaSoneras whollyowned subsidiary, registered at Saint Kitts and Nevis, a tax haven. Though capital gains tax needs to be paid by the company that gains from the deal, TeliaSonera has already exited Nepal.',\n",
       " 'Economist Swarnim Wagle has said the government can afford to announce a relief package of Rs 100 billion to address the economic problems arising due to the COVID19 pandemic.Talking in the Barabara Adams Talk Series through video conferencing, the former National Planning Commission (NPC) vicechair said the government can bring a package of Rs 100 billion stepping on the existing laws to address the problems.\"We have the chronic problem of lack of budget spending. We can redirect the budget halting everything else. We are in a position to announce a package of over Rs 100 billion,\" he pointed. \"It will be late if the government waits to estimate the damages and then take decision. It should provide psychological support now.\"Pointing that the service sector, that makes a contribution of 60 percent to the gross domestic product (GDP), has been hardly hit by the pandemic and the resulting lockdown, he recommended the government to give an immediate moratorium of twothree months in paying taxes, fees and fines. \"The government can provide a rebate of 510 percent to those who paid tax last year. That will act as an incentive or relief to persons who are connected to the formal sector through tax.\"He suggested that bridging loans can be provided to firms with conditions that they do not lay off staffers. He pointed that those working in the organized sector can be helped by mobilizing the money remaining idle in the Social Security Fund. \"Clause 10(6) of the act about social security fund based on contribution has a provision of bringing unemployment assistance. The fund has billions of rupees.\"He stressed that the government should think about those working in the unorganized and informal sectors on daily wages. \"The PM Employment Program was criticized last year. It was used to dole out money to the party cadres for chasing away monkeys, cutting grass and other trivial things. Those working for daily wages can be given money through the program if it were operated in a meaningful way. There will be some meaningful work as well,\" he opined. \"Around Rs 25,000 can be given by making them work in accordance to the program concept of guaranteeing work for a minimum of 100 days.\"He also urged the government to think about the shrinking remittance income and ban on workers going abroad for employment. \"There is a welfare fund under the foreign employment act. The money in the fund can be used.\"He said the pandemic will create challenges for the next eight10 months and added that the government also has an opportunity to do some work. \"We economists say that Nepal has been pinned by the compulsion of being landlocked. But we have the opportunity of digitization now. We can take a huge leap in ecommerce, elearning and ebanking that was developing gradually until now.\"',\n",
       " 'Oil prices are plunging amid concern a dispute among producers could lead a global economy weakened by COVID19 to be awash in an oversupply of crude.Brent crude, the international standard, lost 11.44, or 25.3, to 33.83 per barrel in electronic trading in London. Benchmark U.S. crude fell 10.77, or 26.1, to 30.49.The dramatic losses follow a 10.1 drop for U.S. oil on Friday, which was its biggest loss in more than five years. Prices are falling as Saudi Arabia, Russia and other oilproducing countries argue how much to cut production in order to prop up prices.Demand for energy is falling as people cut back on travel. The worry is that the new coronavirus will slow economies sharply, meaning even less demand.Stephen Innes, chief markets strategist at AxiCorp, called reports that Saudi Arabia could increase its oil production in order to gain market share a shockandawe strategy.The oil market has seen arguments like this before. In 2014, OPEC held off production cuts in order to hold onto market share in the face of a resurgent U.S. oil industry. That led to oil to tumble from over 100 a barrel to below 40 by 2015.This most recent plummet for oil adds another punch to whats already been a brutal and dizzying couple weeks for financial markets worldwide. The U.S. stock market is down 12.2 since setting its record last month on worries about how much corporate profits will fall because of COVID19. Its set on Monday to mark the 11th anniversary of hitting bottom after the 2008 financial crisis.Treasury yields have plummeted to record lows as investors pile into anything that looks safe, almost regardless of how little it pays. The 10year Treasury yield pierced below 1 for the first time on Tuesday, only to breach 0.70 Friday.The virus usually leaves people with only mild to moderate symptoms, but because its new, experts cant say for sure how far it will ultimately spread and how much damage it will do, both to health and to the economy. The number of cases has reached 109,000 globally, and Italy on Sunday tried to quarantine a region holding more than a quarter of its population in hopes of corralling it.If the number of new infections slows in other parts of the world as it has in China, if the U.S. jobs market remains as solid as its been and if all the unease in markets ends up creating just a shortterm dip in confidence among shoppers, all this may recede quickly. But those are a lot of potential pain points.There are more ifs than at any other time in this 11year bull market, say strategists at BTIG.',\n",
       " 'Worldwide markets plummeted again Thursday, deepening a weeklong rout triggered by growing anxiety that the coronavirus will wreak havoc on the global economy. The sweeping selloff gave U.S. stocks their worst oneday drop since 2011.The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled nearly 1,200 points. The SP 500 has now plunged 12 from the alltime high it set just a week ago. That puts the index in what market watchers call a correction, which some analysts have said was long overdue in this bull market, the longest in history.Stocks are now headed for their worst week since October 2008, during the global financial crisis.The losses extended a slide that has wiped out the solid gains major indexes posted early this year. Investors came into 2020 feeling confident that the Federal Reserve would keep interest rates at low levels and the U.S.China trade war posed less of a threat to company profits after the two sides reached a preliminary agreement in January. Even in the early days of the outbreak, markets took things in stride.But over the past two weeks, a growing list of major companies issued warnings that profits could suffer as factory shutdowns across China disrupt supply chains and consumers there refrain from shopping. Travel to and from China is severely restricted, and shares of airlines, hotels and cruise operators have been punished in stock markets. As the virus spread beyond China, markets feared the economic issues in China could escalate globally.One sign of that is the big decline in oil prices, which slumped on expectations that demand will tail off sharply.This is a market thats being driven completely by fear, said Elaine Stokes, portfolio manager at Loomis Sayles, with market movements following the classic characteristics of a fear trade Stocks are down. Commodities are down, and bonds are up.Bond prices soared again Thursday as investors fled to safe investments. The yield on the benchmark 10year Treasury note fell as low as 1.246, a record low, according to TradeWeb. When yields fall, its a sign that investors are feeling less confident about the strength of the economy.Stokes said the swoon reminded her of the markets reaction following the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.Eventually were going to get to a place where this fear, its something that we get used to living with, the same way we got used to living with the threat of living with terrorism, she said. But right now, people dont know how or when were going to get there, and what people do in that situation is to retrench.The virus has now infected more than 82,000 people globally and is worrying governments with its rapid spread beyond the epicenter of China.Japan will close schools nationwide to help control the spread of the new virus. Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims from entering the kingdom to visit Islams holiest sites. Italy has become the center of the outbreak in Europe, with the spread threatening the financial and industrial centers of that nation.At their heart, stock prices rise and fall with the profits that companies make. And Wall Streets expectations for profit growth are sliding away. Apple and Microsoft, two of the worlds biggest companies, have already said their sales this quarter will feel the economic effects of the virus.Goldman Sachs on Thursday said earnings for companies in the SP 500 index might not grow at all this year, after predicting earlier that they would grow 5.5. Strategist David Kostin also cut his growth forecast for earnings next year.Besides a sharply weaker Chinese economy in the first quarter of this year, he sees lower demand for U.S. exporters, disruptions to supply chains and general uncertainty eating away at earnings growth.Such cuts are even more impactful now because stocks are already trading at high levels relative to their earnings, raising the risk. Before the virus worries exploded, investors had been pushing stocks higher on expectations that strong profit growth was set to resume for companies after declining for most of 2019.The SP 500 recently traded at its most expensive level, relative to its expected earnings per share, since the dotcom bubble was deflating in 2002, according to FactSet. If profit growth doesnt ramp up this year, that makes a highly priced stock market even more vulnerable.Goldman Sachs Kostin predicted the SP 500 could fall to 2,900 in the near term, which would be a nearly 7 drop from Wednesdays close, before rebounding to 3,400 by the end of the year.Traders are growing increasingly certain that the Federal Reserve will be forced to cut interest rates to protect the economy, and soon. They are pricing in a 96 probability of a cut at the Feds next meeting in March. Just a day before, they were calling for only a 33 chance, according to CME Group.The markets sharp drop this week partly reflects increasing fears among many economists that the U.S. and global economies could take a bigger hit from the coronavirus than they previously thought.Earlier assumptions that the impact would largely be contained in China and would temporarily disrupt manufacturing supply chains have been overtaken by concerns that as the virus spreads, more people in numerous countries will stay home, either voluntarily or under quarantine. Vacations could be canceled, restaurant meals skipped, and fewer shopping trips taken.A global recession is likely if COVID19 becomes a pandemic, and the odds of that are uncomfortably high and rising with infections surging in Italy and Korea, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moodys Analytics.The market rout will also likely weaken Americans confidence in the economy, analysts say, even among those who dont own shares. Such volatility can worry people about their own companies and job security. In addition, Americans that do own stocks feel less wealthy. Both of those trends can combine to discourage consumer spending and slow growth.MARKET ROUNDUPThe SP 500 fell 137.63 points, or 4.4, to 2,978.76. The Dow fell 1,190.95 points, or 4.4, to 25,766.64.

       " 'This should have been a good year for global tourism, with trade tensions gradually easing, certain economies growing and banner events like the Summer Olympics taking place in Tokyo. But the viral outbreak in China has thrown the travel industry into chaos, threatening billions in losses and keeping millions of wouldbe travelers at home.Gabrielle Autry, an American who lives in China, had expected to travel to Hong Kong this week to get engaged to her Chinese boyfriend. But those plans are on hold, and the couple is quarantined in their apartment in Hangzhou, an eighthour drive from the epicenter of the outbreak in Wuhan. As of Friday, China reported more than 31,000 cases and 636 deaths.We are thankful for our health and that we are together here, Autry said. She doesnt know when they will be able to reschedule their trip.Thirty airlines have suspended service to China and 25,000 flights were canceled this week alone, according to OAG, a travel data company. Hotel rooms in China are largely empty Chinese hotel occupancy plummeted 75 in the last two weeks of January, according to STR, a hotel research firm. More than 7,000 passengers arequarantined on two cruise shipsin Japan and Hong Kong.Before the outbreak, the United Nations World Tourism Organization was forecasting growth of 34 in global tourism this year, an increase over the 1.5 billion tourist arrivals in 2019. Upsides, like economic improvement in the Middle East and Latin America, outweighed some potential downsides, like the uncertainty of Brexit or any lingering U.S.China trade disputes.Central to those numbers was the promise of an evergrowing number of travelers from China, where rapidly growing incomes have led to a global tourism boom. In 2018, Chinese tourists made nearly 150 million trips abroad and spent 277 billion, according to IHS Markit. Thats up from just 15.4 billion in 2002.The loss of those tourists is being felt most acutely in Asia, which usually attracts 75 of Lunar New Year travelers, says ForwardKeys, a travel consulting company. The new year, which began Jan. 25, is one of Chinas major travel periods.Disney said Wednesday it could lose 175 million if its parks in Hong Kong and Shanghai remain closed for two months.Thailand expects to lose 9.7 billion in tourist income from Chinese travelers through June, Tourism and Sports Minister Pipat Ratchakitprakan told The Associated Press.The day that we heard the news (about the virus), the tourists were gone, said Arisara Chamsue, who runs a shop near the Grand Palace in Bangkok. The number has dropped. And I can only make a tenth or two tenths of what I normally make.Tourists from elsewhere are also canceling travel to Asia. Brian Guyer of Bozeman, Montana, planned to go to Japan next week for a dream ski vacation after finding a good deal on Alaska Airlines. But he and his partner decided to cancel because the trip required a 14hour layover in Beijing. They werent sure theyd be allowed to enter Japan or the U.S. after passing through China.Others are taking a waitandsee approach, including concert pianist Julio Elizalde and violinist Ray Chen. The two have a sixcity concert tour of China scheduled in May. Theyre watching closely as long as things improve over the next month or two, Elizalde says they plan to honor that commitment.The cancellations, however, are adding up for airlines. Tourism Economics, a data and consulting firm, estimates that U.S. airlines will lose 1.6 billion this year because of lost business to and from China. The firm doesnt have estimates for Chinese airlines.Cruise lines are also feeling the pinch. Carnival and Royal Caribbean have canceled around 20 China cruises between them, and many cruise lines arent letting passengers board if they have been in China or Hong Kong in the 14 days before the ship sails. That affects thousands of passengers Royal Caribbeans Shanghaibased Spectrum of the Seas ship has a doubleoccupancy capacity of 4,246 people.Miamibased Royal Caribbean estimates that the cancellations so far will shave about 1 off 2020 earnings, and that will double if travel restrictions in China are still in place at the end of February.Destinations further from the outbreak are also feeling the loss of Chinese tourists. Australia, already battered by wildfires, just imposed a travel ban on visitors from mainland China. China was the largest source for international visitors to Australia last year, with 1.4 million tourists who spent 13.4 billion, according to IHS Markit.Italy could lose 5 billion in tourism revenue this year, said Demoskopika, a polling agency. In the U.S., Tourism Economics predicts a 28 drop in Chinese visitors, to around 2 million. That represents about 6 billion less spent on travel and airfare.Some worried travelers are even canceling trips to places that arent yet impacted. Stanley Kolodziejczak, tax director at White and Case law firm in New York, planned to visit South Africa and Brazil this year, but those trips are on hold. Hes concerned those countries wouldnt have the systems in place to detect and manage the virus.But Christina Pedroni, senior vice president of Liberty Travel, a New Jerseybased travel agency, said she hasnt seen many cancellations for destinations outside of Asia. Some customers heading to Asia switched to another destination instead of cancelling entirely, she said.This could change if the situation grows more severe. But for now, most travelers are leaving impending travel plans as they are, Pedroni said.Tourism will recover, as it has from previous health scares. But analysts are divided about the amount of time that recovery will take. Tourism Economics, citing the SARS outbreak in 2003, expects it will be four years before Chinese tourism to the U.S. gets back to previously expected levels. The World Travel and Tourism Council, a tourism advocacy group, says it usually takes 19 months for visitor numbers to recover after a viral outbreak.David Tarsh, a spokesman for ForwardKeys, said there are some key differences with the SARS epidemic, which killed 774 people in 2003. In that case, he said, media reported that the virus was impacting all of southeast Asia, even though it was confined to China, Vietnam, Hong Kong and Singapore. That hurt tourism even in places that were far from the outbreak, like India.This time, he said, travelers are more likely to understand that the virus is centered in Wuhan, China, which could help the recovery progress more quickly.SARS also hit when travelers were still fearful after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in New York, he said. Tarsh also said China has been more open about its response this time around.China has taken very dramatic action, he said.',\n",
       " 'The United States and China reached a trade deal Wednesday that eases tensions between the worlds two biggest economies, offers massive export opportunities for U.S. farms and factories, and promises to do more to protect American trade secrets.Still, the Phase 1 agreement leaves unresolved Washingtons fundamental differences with Beijing, which is relying on massive government intervention in the economy to turn China into a technological power.President Donald Trump is wanting to show progress on an issue that he has made a hallmark of his presidency and hopes to use in his reelection campaign this year. Wednesdays signing ceremony at the White House gave him the chance to do that just hours before the House voted to send articles of impeachment to the Senate for a trial.Trump promoted the trade signing as a way of delivering economic justice for American workers he claims have been betrayed by past administrations and their trade policies.We mark more than just an agreement. We mark a sea change in international trade, Trump declared during a rambling ceremony in which he made references to former FBI Director James Comey, the impeachment proceedings and a possible visit to Mount Rushmore on July Fourth for a fireworks display.The Chinese delegation also praised the pact. Chinese leader Xi Jinping said in a letter to Trump that the firstphase deal was good for China, for the U.S. and for the whole world. He said it also showed the two countries had the ability to act on the basis of equality and mutual respect. The letter was read by Beijings chief negotiator, Vice Premier Liu He.Some of the presidents Democratic critics were unimpressed.True to form, Trump is getting precious little in return for the significant pain and uncertainty he has imposed on our economy, farmers, and workers, said former Vice President Joe Biden, one of the Democrats hoping to replace Trump.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, DCalif., said in a statement that with the economy losing thousands of manufacturing jobs and Farm Country reeling from the damage caused by President Trump, Americans are left with nothing more than a showy television ceremony to try to hide the complete absence of concrete progress, transparency or accountability in this ‘phase one agreement.The administration acknowledges the agreement leaves unresolved some U.S. complaints  most notably, the way the Chinese government subsidizes its companies. That was the concern voiced when Trump sparked a trade war by imposing tariffs on Chinese imports in July 2018.The Phase 1 deal contains meaningful commitments but by no means lives up to the initial objectives of the administration, said Wendy Cutler, a former U.S. trade negotiator who is now vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute. Further Chinese concessions would force Bejing to make major changes in its statedominated economic model, which means the prospects for a timely conclusion are remote, she said.The agreement leaves in place tariffs on about 360 billion in Chinese imports, leverage the administration hopes will generate future concessions.U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said work on followup negotiations will hinge on how China fulfills the commitments it made in the initial phase.We have to make sure this is implemented properly, Lighthizer said. This is the first agreement like this of its kind and we have to make sure that it works.The agreement is intended to ease some U.S. economic sanctions on China while Beijing is to step up purchases of American farm products and other goods. Trump cited beef, pork, poultry, seafood, rice and dairy products as examples.U.S. trade officials said the agreement would end a longstanding practice of China pressuring foreign companies to transfer technology to Chinese companies as a condition for obtaining market access. Lighthizer said China has also agreed to combat patent theft and counterfeit products, which would include forfeiting machinery used for making counterfeit products.The 86page agreement makes it easier to bring criminal cases in China against those accused of stealing trade secrets. It includes provisions designed to stop Chinese government officials from using administrative and regulatory procedures to ferret out foreign companies trade secrets and allowing that information to get into the hands of Chinese competitors.The deal requires China to come up with procedures to permit effective and expeditious action to take down websites that sell pirated goods. China also must make it possible for ecommerce sites to lose their licenses for repeated failures to curb the sale of counterfeit or pirated goods.China is required to increase its purchases of U.S. manufactured, energy and farm products and services by a combined 200 billion this year and next. The arrangement means that China is supposed to buy 40 billion in U.S. farm exports. That would be a windfall for Trump supporters in rural America but an ambitious goal considering that China has never bought more than 26 billion in U.S. agricultural products in a year.Its a strong first step, said Jeremie Waterman, the U.S. Chamber of Commerces vice president for Greater China. It begins the process of addressing some of the structural concerns, but theres a lot of work left to do. The meat, the core of (U.S. complaints about Chinas aggressive tech policies) has not yet been addressed. Obviously, thats going to have to wait until Phase 2.Most analysts say any meaningful resolution of the main U.S. allegation  that Beijing uses predatory tactics in its drive to supplant Americas technological supremacy  could require years of contentious talks. Skeptics say a satisfactory resolution may be next to impossible given Chinas ambitions to become the global leader in such advanced technologies as driverless cars and artificial intelligence.The U.S. has dropped plans to impose tariffs on an additional 160 billion in Chinese imports, and it cut in half, to 7.5, existing tariffs on 110 billion of good from China.Derek Scissors, China specialist at the American Enterprise Institute, said the trade war has already delivered a benefit for Trump, even if it hasnt forced Beijing to make major changes to its economic policy Trumps tariffs have reduced Chinese exports to the United States and narrowed Americas trade deficit with China.So far this year, the U.S. deficit with China in the trade of goods has declined by 16, or 62 billion, to 321 billion compared with a year earlier. The deficit will narrow further if Beijing lives up to its pledges to buy dramatically more American imports.',\n",
       " 'In a daring escape that confounded authorities, Nissans former Chairman Carlos Ghosn skipped bail while awaiting trial in Japan on allegations of financial misconduct and reappeared in Lebanon, where he said Tuesday that he had fled to avoid political persecution.Ghosn, who is of Lebanese origin and holds French, Lebanese and Brazilian passports, disclosed his location in a statement through his representatives but did not say how he managed to get out of Japan, where he had been under surveillance. He promised to talk to reporters next week.I am now in Lebanon and will no longer be held hostage by a rigged Japanese justice system where guilt is presumed, discrimination is rampant, and basic human rights are denied, in flagrant disregard of Japans legal obligations under international law and treaties it is bound to uphold, the statement said.Speaking anonymously, prosecutors in Japan told Japanese media they did not know how Ghosn got out. His lawyer also denied all knowledge of the escape, saying he was stunned. Japan does not have an extradition treaty with Lebanon, which said Ghosn had entered the country legally and there was no reason to take any action against him.He is home, Ghosns friend, television host Ricardo Karam said in a message. Its a big adventure.Karam said Ghosn arrived in Lebanon on Monday morning, but declined to elaborate. The Lebanonbased newspaper AlJoumhouriya said Ghosn arrived in Beirut from Turkey aboard a private jet.Ghosn was arrested in November 2018 and was expected to face trial in April 2020. He posted 1.5 billion yen (14 million) bail on two separate instances after he was arrested a second time on additional charges, and released again.Prosecutors fought his release, but a court granted him bail on condition that he be monitored and not meet with his wife, Carole, who is also of Lebanese origin. Recently, the court allowed them to speak by video.Ghosn, who was charged with underreporting his future compensation and breach of trust, has repeatedly asserted his innocence, saying authorities trumped up charges to prevent a possible fuller merger between Nissan Motor Co. and alliance partner Renault SA.Maybe he thought he wont get a fair trial, said his lawyer, Junichiro Hironaka, stressing that he continues to believe Ghosn is innocent. I cant blame him for thinking that way.The charges Ghosn faces carry a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison.How Ghosn managed to flee was, publicly at least, a mystery. Hironaka said the lawyers were holding Ghosns three passports, yet Lebanons minister for presidential affairs, Selim Jreissati, told the AnNahar newspaper that Ghosn entered legally at the airport with a French passport and Lebanese ID.France reacted with surprise and some confusion.The French foreign ministry said in a statement that French authorities have heard from the press about the arrival of Carlos Ghosn to Lebanon. They have not been informed of his departure from Japan and have no knowledge of the circumstances of his departure, the statement said.Agnes PannierRunacher, a junior finance minister, told broadcaster BFMTV that I was surprised as you when I learned about this escape.Ghosns lawyer, Hironaka, said he last spoke with his client on Christmas Day and was never consulted about leaving for Lebanon. However, he said the circumstances of Ghosns arrest, the seizure of evidence and the strict bail conditions were unfair.Jreissati told AnNaharhe he had asked Japan to hand Ghosn over to be tried in Lebanon according to international anticorruption laws. However, since there was no official word from Tokyo and it was not yet clear how Ghosn came to Lebanon, Beirut wouldnt take a formal position. Jreissati did not immediately respond to calls from The Associated Press.People in Lebanon take special pride in the auto industry icon, who is credited with leading a spectacular turnaround at Nissan beginning in the late 1990s, and rescued the automaker from nearbankruptcy.Ghosn speaks fluent Arabic and visited the country regularly. Born in Brazil, where his Lebanese grandfather had sought his fortune, Ghosn grew up in Beirut, where he spent part of his childhood at a Jesuit school.Before his fall from grace, Ghosn was also a celebrity in Japan, where he was revered for his managerial acumen.Nissan did not have immediate comment Tuesday. The Japanese automaker of the March subcompact, Leaf electric car and Infiniti luxury models has also been charged as a company in relation to Ghosns alleged financial crimes.Japanese securities regulators recently recommended Nissan be fined 2.4 billion yen (22 million) over disclosure documents from 2014 to 2017. Nissan has said it accepted the penalty and corrected its securities documents in May.The companys sales and profits have tumbled and its brand image is tarnished. It has acknowledged lapses in its governance and has promised to improve its transparency.Another former Nissan executive, Greg Kelly, an American, was arrested at the same time as Ghosn and is awaiting trial. He has said he is innocent.Hiroto Saikawa, who replaced Ghosn as head of Nissan, announced his resignation in September after financial misconduct allegations surfaced against him related to his income. He has not been charged with any crime.The conviction rate in Japan exceeds 99 and winning an acquittal through a lengthy appeals process could take years. Rights activists in Japan and abroad say Japans judicial system does not presume innocence enough and relies on long detentions that lead to false confessions.In addition to underreporting his future compensation, Ghosn is accused of diverting Nissan money and having it shoulder his personal investment losses. Other allegations against him involve payments to a Saudi dealership, as well as funds paid to an Oman business that were purportedly diverted to entities run by Ghosn.Ghosn has said that the compensation was never decided, that Nissan never suffered losses from the investments and that all the payments were for legitimate business services.',\n",
       " 'Chinas Huawei Technologies said Tuesday that its sales rose a lowerthanprojected 18 in 2019 and predicted tough times ahead as the U.S. moves to restrict its business.The flash sales estimate came in an annual New Years message to employees. Chairman Eric Xu warned that mediocre managers would face demotion as the telecom giant and leader in 5G mobile technology focuses on survival.Its going to be a difficult year for us, he wrote, calling on the companys more than 190,000 employees to work hard and go the extra mile to bring their capabilities to a new level.No one is predicting Huaweis demise. The unlisted company, a major maker of both mobile transmission equipment and handsets, estimated that 2019 sales would rise to more than 850 billion yuan (120 billion).These figures are lower than our initial projections, yet business remains solid and we stand strong in the face of adversity, Xu said in the letter, which was released to The Associated Press and other media.Huawei, based in the tech hub of Shenzhen in southern China, typically releases its official and audited annual financial results in March.Zou Zhidan, an analyst at the consulting firm Zero Power in Shenzhen, said that given Huaweis size and the breadth of its business, it wont face a survival crisis. Rather, it will face obstacles to progress and pressure on its rapid profit growth, he said in an email response to questions.Zou noted that Huawei enjoys a relatively good reputation outside of the U.S. and will benefit from its leading position in the still nascent 5G market.The difficulties for Huawei in 2020 wont be small, but the company has its own strengths, Zou wrote.The U.S. government says Huawei technology poses a security risk and has urged other countries not to buy its 5G mobile network equipment. It has also put Huawei on its entity list, blocking U.S. technology sales to the company. Huawei denies the allegation.Calling difficulty the prelude to greater success, Xu said Americas strategic and longterm campaign against Huawei is an opportunity to build up some muscle and build capabilities to navigate future challenges.Despite concerted efforts by the U.S. government to keep us down, weve made it out the other side and continue to create value for our customers, he wrote.The fivepage letter exhorts employees to hone their skills and rid themselves of complacency. Saying that survival is the companys top priority, Xu warns that mediocre managers who have lost their enterprising spirit will be removed faster than before.',\n",
       " 'The Trump administration and China are close to finalizing a modest trade agreement that would suspend tariffs that are set to kick in Sunday, deescalating their 17month trade war.A deal is close, said Myron Brilliant, the U.S. Chamber of Commerces head of international affairs, who has been briefed by both sides.Brilliant said the administration has agreed to suspend Trumps plans to impose tariffs on 160 billion in Chinese imports Sunday and to reduce existing tariffs, though it wasnt clear by how much.In return, Beijing would buy more U.S. farm products, increase Americans companies access to the Chinese market and tighten protection for intellectual property rights.The deal awaits final approval from President Donald Trump.Trump took to Twitter early Thursday to declare Getting VERY close to a BIG DEAL with China. They want it, and so do we!The presidents comments triggered a daylong rally on Wall Street. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 220 points, or 0.8.Thursday evening, a senior administration official said a policy announcement regarding China would take place on Friday. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal planning.Earlier Thursday, a spokesman for Chinas Ministry of Commerce, Gao Feng, had told reporters that the economic and trade teams of both sides have maintained close communication. He offered no additional details.Beijing had threatened to retaliate if Trump proceeded with plans to raise tariffs on 160 billion of Chinese imports Sunday.The two sides are negotiating a socalled Phase 1 agreement as part of the effort to resolve their sprawling trade dispute. Still, the truce leaves unsettled the toughest and most complex issues that have divided the two sides.Three Democratic senators  Minority Leader Charles Schumer of New York, Ron Wyden of Oregon and Sherrod Brown of Ohio  sent a letter to the White House on Thursday, urging Trump to stand firm in the negotiations with China. They called on the president to hold out for commitments from the Chinese government to enact substantive, enforceable and permanent structural reform.The administration accuses Beijing of cheating in its drive to achieve global supremacy in such advanced technologies as driverless cars and artificial intelligence. The administration alleges  and independent analysts generally agree  that China steals technology, forces foreign companies to hand over trade secrets, unfairly subsidizes its own firms and throws up bureaucratic hurdles for foreign rivals.Beijing rejects the accusations and contends that Washington is simply trying to suppress a rising competitor in international trade.Since July 2018, the Trump administration has imposed import taxes on 360 billion in Chinese products. Beijing has retaliated by taxing 120 billion in U.S. exports, including soybeans and other farm products that are vital to many of Trumps supporters in rural America.On Sunday, the administration was set to start taxing an additional 160 billion in Chinese imports, a move that would extend the sanctions to just about everything China ships to the United States.Repeated rounds of negotiations had failed to achieve even a preliminary agreement. The prolonged uncertainty over Trumps trade policies has curtailed U.S. business investment and likely held back economic growth. Many corporations have slowed or suspended investment plans until they know when, how or even whether the trade standoff will end.A farreaching agreement on Chinas technology policies will likely prove difficult. It would require Beijing to scale back its drive to become a global powerhouse in industrial high technology, something it sees as a path to prosperity and international influence.Efforts to acquire foreign technology are a theme that runs through Chinese law and government. Security researchers have asserted that Beijing operates a network of research institutes and business parks to turn stolen foreign technology into commercial products.The Trump administration has been seeking a way to enforce any significant trade agreement with China, reflecting its contention that Beijing has violated past promises. One way to do is to retain some tariffs as leverage.Theyre two such different economies that dont trust each other, said Jessica Wasserman, a trade lawyer at Greenspoon Marder LLP.',\n",

       " 'For decades, Huaweis founder stayed out of sight as it grew to become the biggest maker of network gear for phone carriers and passed Apple as the No. 2 smartphone brand.Now, Ren Zhengfei is shedding that anonymity as Chinas first global tech brand mobilizes to fight back against U.S. sanctions and warnings Huawei Technologies Ltd. is a security risk.The entrepreneur at the center of the Trump administrations battle with Beijing over technology is a survivor of competition that drove Western rivals out of the market, brushes with financial disaster and job stress so severe he contemplated suicide.The 75yearold former army engineer who worked his way out of childhood poverty sees American pressure as just the latest of the tests that have hardened him and his company.For three decades, Huawei has been suffering and no joy, Ren said in an interview. The pain of each episode is different.This episode has a personal dimension Rens daughter, Huaweis chief financial officer, is under arrest in Canada on U.S. charges she helped to violate sanctions against Iran.The escalating clash with Washington has transformed Ren from an admired but rarely seen businessman worth an estimated 3 billion into one of Chinas most prominent figures.He belongs to the generation of entrepreneurs who founded communistera Chinas first private companies in the 1980s. They navigated a shifting, statedominated landscape, overcoming shortages of money and technology to create industries that are expanding abroad.Ren launched Huawei in 1987 after his military post was eliminated.Huawei is a star in industries the ruling Communist Party is promoting but a target for complaints those plans are based on stealing or pressuring foreign companies to hand over business secrets.Despite his success, Ren talks like a struggling rookie, worrying aloud that employees might get too comfortable.Ren writes letters urging employees to prepare for the worst, said Nicole Peng of Canalys, an industry research firm.As for whether his character can help the company to survive, said Peng, Im sure it will. It will survive. Like he said, they are prepared for it. They know there is always difficulty.Born in 1944, Ren was raised by a schoolteacher who he said fed seven children on a monthly wage of 40 yuan (6).When Ren was a teenager, the ruling party embarked on the Great Leap Forward, a disastrous campaign to become an industrial power overnight. At least 30 million people died in the 195961 famine that followed.Rens mother declared no one would die and divided each meal into nine portions, one for each family member, said Tian Tao, coauthor of The Huawei Story.His mothers ‘meal system had a big impact on him, said Tian.Following that ethos, Huawei says it is owned by the Chinese citizens who make up half its workforce of 180,000. Rens ownership has declined to 1.14 as more shares are distributed to employees.Ren joined the army in the 1960s and was sent to the northeast to build a textile factory. He said he slept outdoors in weather as cold as 28 C (18 F) and ate noodles and pickled radish.Ren says he has tried to ensure Huaweis longterm survival through a system of shared decisionmaking. Still, he is known as a forceful, even autocratic, decisionmaker.That was highlighted by a battle in 2000 over whether to develop the personal handyphone system, which caught on as a lowcost alternative to mobile service. Ren rejected PHS as a distraction from work on nextgeneration mobile technology that promised to be cheaper and more reliable.Ren said he resisted appeals to back PHS as bills for 3G development rose to 6 billion yuan (750 million).Todays crisis is onetenth or 1 of the pressure at that time, Ren said.Tian, his biographer, said Huawei employees told him Ren, unable to sleep, would call and worry aloud about how to pay a 300 million yuan (50 million) monthly wage bill.When Ren Zhengfei talked with employees six or seven years ago, he revealed a secret He had suicidal thoughts several times, said Tian, a Huawei adviser and codirector of the Ruihua Innovation Research Institute at Zhejiang University.Following his daughters December 2018 arrest in Vancouver, Huawei launched a charm offensive aimed at defusing Western suspicions the company facilitates Chinese spying.Ren gives interviews lasting up to two hours to reporters and TV crews who trek to Shenzhen, a former fishing village near Hong Kong that is now a technology center of 15 million people.Ren, a ruling party member, tried to defuse security concerns by promising in January he would defy any official demands to reveal foreign customers secrets.Huawei, along with Nokia Corp. and LM Ericsson, leads in fifthgeneration telecom technology. It is meant to upgrade and expand networks to support selfdriving cars and other futuristic applications. But that increased reach makes 5G politically sensitive.The companys U.S. market vanished in 2012 after a congressional panel declared Huawei a security risk.Despite that, sales tripled as Huawei made inroads into Europe, Asia and Africa. Sales last year rose almost 20 percent to 105 billion.U.S. export controls, if enforced, will disrupt Huaweis access to processor chips and other technology. Its smartphones would lose Google maps and other services, making it hard to compete.To limit that impact, Ren has emphasized making Huawei a selfreliant technology creator. This years research spending is due to rise 20 to 17 billion.The company has released a smartphone operating system it says can replace Googles Android if necessary. It makes some of its own processor chips but needs U.S. suppliers for highend products.They do things from scratch, said Peng. I think this is the influence of the founder.',\n",
       " 'Saudi Arabia formally started its longanticipated initial public offering of its staterun oil giant Saudi Aramco on Sunday, which will see a sliver of the firm offered on a local stock exchange in hopes of raising billions of dollars for the kingdom.An announcement from the kingdoms Capital Market Authority announcing its approval for the share sale served as a starting gun for an IPO promised by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman since 2016.The firms shares will be traded on Riyadhs Tadawul stock exchange, said Amin H. Nasser, the president and CEO of Aramco, in an online video. Plans call for the firm to put other shares on a foreign exchange in the future.This is transformational and historic moment for Saudi Aramco, Nasser said. He also stressed Aramcos disciplined financial approach and prudent and flexible balance sheet.Prince Mohammed hopes for a veryoptimistic 2 trillion valuation for Aramco, which produces 10 million barrels of crude oil a day and provides some 10 of global demand. That would raise the 100 billion he needs for his ambitious redevelopment plans for a Saudi Arabia hoping for new jobs, as unemployment stands at over 10.However, economic worries, the trade war between China and the U.S. and increased crude oil production by the U.S. has depressed energy prices. A Sept. 14 attack on the heart of Aramco already spooked some investors, with one ratings company already downgrading the oil giant.The announcement by the Capital Market Authority offered no timeline for the IPO, nor did documents later released by Aramco.The Capital Market Authority board has issued its resolution approving the Saudi Arabian Oil Co. application for the registration and offering of part of its shares, the authority said in its statement. The companys prospectus will be published prior to the start of the subscription period.The Saudiowned satellite channel AlArabiya reported last week, citing anonymous sources, that pricing for the stock will begin Nov. 17. A final price for the stock will be set Dec. 4, with shares then beginning to be traded on the Tadawul on Dec. 11, the channel reported. The channel is believed to have close links to the kingdoms Al Saud royal family.Aramco in its IPO documentation said the percentage of the company offered and the share price will be determined at the end of the bookbuilding period. It said Aramco had a net income of 111.1 billion in 2018 and proven liquid reserves of 226.8 billion barrels. It said its net income as of the end of the third quarter this year was 68 billion.Shares will be offered to institutional investors, as well as individual Saudi and foreign investors.The kingdom has in the past used the company as a piggy bank for development companies, back when it was still an American company. Since buying a 100 interest in the firm by 1980, the royal family as its sole shareholder largely hasnt interfered in the companys longterm business decisions as its revenue provides around 60 of all government revenue.But recently, there have been decisions seemingly forced onto Aramco, including the nearly 70 billion purchase in March of the petrochemical firm Saudi Basic Industries Corp. just before SABIC announced a plunge in its quarterly profits.In Aramcos firstever halfyear results, it reported income of 46.8 billion. Yet analysts say a 2 trillion valuation  Apple and Microsoft separately for instance are 1 trillion  may be a stretch. By announcing the start of the IPO on Sunday, Prince Mohammed may have been convinced to take a lower valuation in order to get the IPO moving. The kingdom likely is pinning its hopes on tremendous local interest to push up the companys valuation before potentially taking some of the stock abroad.Analysts believe Aramco will list as much as 3 of the firm on the Tadawul, with another 2 put abroad.Saudi Aramco has sought to assure investors, given the questions over its valuation and the potential hazards of future attacks or geopolitical risk. A presentation posted to Aramcos website last month announced the intent to offer a 75 billion dividend for investors in 2020. Thats the payment per share that a corporation distributes to its stockholders as their return on the money they have invested in its stock.It also pledged that some 2020 through 2024, any year with a dividend under 75 billion would see nongovernment shareholders prioritized to get paid.But beyond the stocks, worries persist that Saudi Arabia could be hit by another attack like the one Sept. 14, which the U.S. blames on Iran. Iran denies it launched the cruise missiles and drones used in the attack.

The government noted growth in activity compared with the final quarter of 2020, when a recovery already had begun, was a more modest 0.6.Manufacturing, auto sales and other consumer activity have revived to above prepandemic levels since the ruling Communist Party declared victory over the coronavirus last March and allowed factories and stores to reopen.The economy delivered a stable performance with a consolidated foundation and good momentum of growth, the National Bureau of Statistics said in a report.The outsize jump in the headline number was in line with expectations by forecasters due to the low basis for comparison in early 2020.Some warn that despite Chinas impressive recent performance, a recovery still is uncertain because global demand is weak as some governments reimpose antidisease curbs that disrupt business and trade.The economy shrank by 6.8 in the first quarter of last year as the ruling Communist Party took the thenunprecedented step of closing most factories, shops and offices to fight the outbreak that started in the central city of Wuhan in late 2019. It was Chinas worst performance since at least the mid1960s.Growth recovered to 6.5 over a year earlier in the final quarter following the economys relatively early reopening while the United States, Europe and Japan struggled with renewed disease outbreaks. China eked out fullyear growth of 2.3, becoming the only major economy to expand in 2020.Retail spending surged 33.9 in the first quarter over a year earlier, while factory output rose 24.5, according to the NBS. Investment in real estate, factories and other fixed assets rose 25.6.Chinese exports have benefited from demand for masks and other medical supplies while foreign competitors still face antivirus restrictions. Forecasters say that boost will pass as sales of medical supplies decline and other economies reopen.',\n",
       " 'Jeff Bezos, who founded Amazon as an online bookstore and built it into a shopping and entertainment behemoth, will step down later this year as CEO, a role hes had for nearly 30 years, to become executive chairman, the company announced Tuesday.Bezos, 57, will be replaced in the summer by Andy Jassy, who runs Amazons cloudcomputing business.In a blog post to employees, Bezos said he planned to focus on new products and early initiatives being developed at Amazon. He said he would have more time for side projects, including his space exploration company Blue Origin, his philanthropic initiatives and overseeing The Washington Post, which he owns.Bezos, who is the companys biggest shareholder, will still have broad influence over Amazon.Jeff is really not going anywhere, Amazons Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said in a call with reporters. Its more of a restructuring of whos doing what.Launched in 1995, Amazon was a pioneer of fast, free shipping that won over millions of shoppers who used the site to buy diapers, TVs and just about anything else. Under Bezos, Amazon also launched the first ereader that gained mass acceptance, and its Echo listening device made voice assistants a common sight in living rooms.As a child, Bezos was intrigued by computers and interested in building things, such as alarms he rigged in his parents home. He got a degree in electrical engineering and computer science at Princeton University, and then worked at several Wall Street companies.He quit his job at D.E. Shaw to start an online retail business  though at first he wasnt sure what to sell. Bezos quickly determined that an online bookstore would resonate with consumers. He and his now exwife, MacKenzie Scott, whom he met at D.E. Shaw and married in 1993, set out on a road trip to Seattle  a city chosen for its abundance of tech talent and proximity to a large book distributor in Roseburg, Oregon.While Scott drove, Bezos wrote up the business plan for what would become Amazon.com. Bezos convinced his parents and some friends to invest in the idea, and Amazon began operating out of the Bezos Seattle garage on July 16, 1995.Amazon has gone far beyond selling paperbacks. It now produces movies, makes sofas, owns a grocery chain and even has plans to send satellites into space to beam internet service to earth. The company is one of the most valuable in the world, worth nearly 1.7 trillion.During the pandemic, Amazon was one of the few retailers to benefit as shoppers stayed clear of malls and shopped from their phones. On the same day Amazon announced Bezos would step down, the company reported making a record profit in the last three months of 2020, and its quarterly revenue shot past 100 billion for the first time.Bezos riches have also swelled His stake in Amazon is currently worth about 180 billion. For years he stayed behind the scenes, running the company. More recently, he sometimes stepped into the spotlight, showing up at movie premieres and Hollywood parties.In 2019, he announced he was divorcing Scott in a tweet, just before the National Enquirer published a cover story saying Bezos had an affair with a former TV host. Scott received a stake in Amazon after the divorce worth nearly 40 billion at the time. She has pledged to give away half her fortune to charities.As Amazon has grown, so has scrutiny. Amazon and other tech giants have enjoyed lighttouch regulation and star status in Washington for decades, but calls for greater regulation are growing. A report by the House Judiciary Committee in October called for possibly breaking up Amazon and others, making it harder for them to acquire companies and imposing new rules to safeguard competition.Bezos is one of the last founders of a big tech company to still be CEO. The founders of Google, Oracle and Microsoft have all stepped down from the top job of the companies they created. Facebook is still led by cofounder Mark Zuckerberg.Jassy, Bezos replacement, is a longtime Amazon executive, having worked at the company since 1997. The cloudcomputing business he runs powers videostreaming site Netflix and many other companies, and it has become Amazons most profitable business.Hes deeply steeped in technology and a very seasoned executive in his own right, Gartner analyst Ed Anderson said.But he will also face many challenges.Amazons size makes some industries uncomfortable, some governments uncomfortable, and Andy Jassy will have to deal with the consequences, Anderson said. That will be some of the new era of his leadership.',\n",
       " 'Chinas highestprofile entrepreneur, Jack Ma, appeared Wednesday in an online video, ending a 2 1/2month absence from public view that prompted speculation about the future of the ecommerce billionaire and his Alibaba Group.In the 50second video, Ma congratulated teachers supported by his foundation and made no mention of his disappearance or official efforts to tighten control over Alibaba and other internet companies over the past six months. The video appeared on Chinese business news and other websites.The normally voluble Ma disappeared from public view after he irked regulators by criticizing them in an Oct. 24 speech at a Shanghai conference. Days later, regulators suspended the planned multibilliondollar stock market debut of Ant Group, a financial platform that grew out of Alibabas payments service, Alipay.That prompted speculation online about whether the 56yearold Ma, Chinas biggest global business celebrity and a symbol of its tech boom, had been detained or might face legal trouble. Alibaba and the government havent responded to questions about him.The Jack Ma Foundation said in a statement Wednesday Jack Ma participated in the online ceremony of the annual Rural Teacher Initiative event on January 20. The foundation and Alibaba didnt respond to questions about Mas status and when his next public event might be.President Xi Jinpings government says antimonopoly enforcement against internet companies will be a priority this year. Alibaba and other companies have been fined for violating antimonopoly rules. Some social media services have been reprimanded for lapses in enforcing censorship.In his October speech, Ma complained regulators had an antique pawnshop mentality and were hampering innovation, according to Chinese media. He appealed to them to make it easier for entrepreneurs and young people to borrow.That clashed with the ruling partys marathon campaign to reduce surging debt in Chinas financial system that prompted fears about a possible bank crisis and led rating agencies to cut Beijings credit rating for government borrowing.Some people suggested the ruling Communist Party was making an example of Ma to show entrepreneurs couldnt defy regulators. But finance experts said Xis government was uneasy about Alibabas dominance in retailing and Ants potential financial risks.Antimonopoly regulators warned executives Alibaba and five other tech giants in December not to use their dominance to block new competitors from entering their markets. The central bank and other regulators have ordered Ant to overhaul its business before its market debut can go ahead.Alibabas share price in Hong Kong is down 10 since October but recovered some of its loss from its low point this month.Ma, a ruling party member, stepped down as Alibaba chairman in 2019 but is a member of the Alibaba Partnership, a 36member group with the right to nominate a majority of the companys board of directors. He played a leading role in developing Ant, which grew out of Alibabas online payment service, Alipay.In the video Wednesday, Ma, wearing a blue sweater over a white T shirt and gray trousers, smiled and waved to viewers. It included a scene the video said showed Ma visiting a school supported by his foundation on Jan. 10.',\n",
       " 'Boeing will pay 2.5 billion to settle a Justice Department investigation and admit that employees misled regulators about the safety of its 737 Max aircraft, which suffered two deadly crashes shortly after entering airline service.The government and the company said Thursday that the settlement includes money for the crash victims families, airline customers and a fine.Prosecutors said Boeing employees gave misleading statements and halftruths about safety issues with the plane to the Federal Aviation Administration, then covered up their actions.Boeings employees chose the path of profit over candor, said David Burns, acting assistant attorney general for the Justice Departments criminal division.Boeing blamed two former pilots who helped determine how much training was needed for the Max. CEO David Calhoun said their conduct doesnt reflect Boeing employees as a whole or the character of the company.This is a substantial settlement of a very serious matter, and I firmly believe that entering into this resolution is the right thing for us to do  a step that appropriately acknowledges how we fell short of our values and expectations, Calhoun said in a memo to employees.The government will drop the criminal charge of conspiracy to defraud the U.S. after three years if Boeing follows the terms of the settlement.The settlement removes uncertainty about criminal charges against the iconic U.S. aircraft maker, which is struggling to put the Max crisis behind it. Boeing still faces lawsuits by the families of passengers who died in the crashes, it has lost more than 1,000 orders for the Max, and its oncestellar reputation for engineering has suffered.Boeing began working on the Max in 2011 as an answer to a new, more fuelefficient model from European rival Airbus. Boeing admitted in court filings that two of its technical pilot experts deceived the FAA about a flightcontrol system called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS, that could point a planes nose down if sensors indicated the plane might be in danger of an aerodynamic stall  that it might fall from the sky.The system was not part of previous 737 models. MCAS was added because the Maxs larger engines, which are mounted higher and farther forward on the 737s lowswept wings, gave the plane a tendency to tilt too far noseup in some conditions.Boeing downplayed the significance of MCAS and didnt mention it in airplane manuals. Most pilots didnt know about it.The first airlines began flying the 737 Max in mid2017. On Oct. 29, 2018, a Max operated by Indonesias Lion Air plunged into the Java Sea. The FAA let the Max keep flying, and on March 10, 2019, another Max operated by Ethiopian Airlines crashed nearly straight down into a field. In all, 346 people were killed.On both flights, MCAS was activated by a faulty reading from a single sensor. The system repeatedly pushed the planes noses down, and pilots were unable to regain control.After the planes were grounded worldwide, Boeing changed MCAS so that it always uses two sensors, along with other changes to make the automated system less powerful and easier for pilots to override. The FAA ordered other changes, including the rerouting of some wiring to avoid potential dangerous shortcircuiting.In November, the FAA approved Boeings changes, and several carriers including American Airlines have resumed using the planes.Under the settlement announced Thursday, Boeing will pay a 243.6 million fine, 1.77 billion in compensation to airlines that were unable to use their Max jets while they were grounded, and 500 million into a fund for the families of passengers who were killed in the crashes.Boeing faces dozens of lawsuits by families who lost relatives in the crashes. Three lawyers pressing cases in the Ethiopian crash said the settlement would not affect their pursuit of compensation.Zipporah Kuria, a U.K. citizen whose father died in the Ethiopian crash, said that with the settlement, Boeing leaders were seeking to pay their way out of accountability. The agreement wont bring back our loved ones, but at least there is clarity that their deaths werent incidental and there is clarity in liability.House Transportation Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio, DOre, meanwhile, said the settlement amounted to a slap on the wrist for a company the size of Boeing.I hope the DOJ can explain its rationale for this weak settlement to the families, because from where I sit this attempt to change corporate behavior is pathetic and will do little to deter criminal behavior going forward, DeFazio said in a statement.Boeing said in a regulatory filing that it will take a 743.6 million charge against earnings because of the settlement.The crashes and grounding of the Max, Boeings bestselling plane, has plunged the Chicagobased company into its deepest crisis. It has led to billions in losses and resulted in the ouster of former CEO Dennis Muilenburg in December 2019.',\n",
       " 'American Airlines flew a Boeing 737 Max with paying passengers from Miami to New York on Tuesday, the planes first commercial flight in U.S. skies since it was grounded after two deadly crashes.American flight 718 carried 87 passengers on the 172seat plane, and the return flight from LaGuardia Airport to Miami International Airport held 151 passengers, according to an airline spokeswoman.Last month, the Federal Aviation Administration approved changes that Boeing made to an automated flightcontrol system implicated in crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that killed 346 people in all. In both crashes, the system pushed the nose down repeatedly based on faulty sensor readings, and pilots were unable to regain control.The FAA cleared the way for U.S. airlines to resume using the plane if certain changes are made and pilots are provided with additional training including time in a flight simulator.Brazils Gol airlines operated the first passenger flight with a revamped Max on Dec. 9. Since then, Gol and Aeromexico have operated about 600 flights between them with Max jets, according to tracking service Flightradar24 and aviationdata firm Cirium.American plans to make one round trip a day between Miami and New York with Max jets through Jan. 4 before putting the plane on more routes. United Airlines plans to resume Max flights in February, and Southwest Airlines expects to follow in March.All three airlines say they will give customers the chance to change flights if they are uncomfortable flying on the Max.The Max was grounded worldwide in March 2019, days after the second crash. Reports by House and Senate committees faulted Boeing and the FAA for failures in the process of certifying the plane. Congressional investigators uncovered internal Boeing documents in which company employees raised safety concerns and bragged about deceiving regulators.FAA Administrator Stephen Dickson, a former military and airline pilot, operated a test flight in September and vouched for the reworked planes safety, saying he would put his family on it. American Airlines President Robert Isom was on Tuesdays inaugural U.S. flight, according to the airline.Some relatives of people who died in the second crash, a Max operated by Ethiopian Airlines, contend that the plane is still unsafe. They and their lawyers say that Boeing is refusing to hand over documents about the planes design and development.The truth is that 346 people are now dead because Boeing cut corners, lied to regulators, and simply considers this the cost of doing business, Yalena LopezLewis, whose husband died in the crash, said in a statement issued by her lawyers. It is infuriating that American Airlines is in effect rewarding Boeing for the corrupt and catastrophic process that led to the Max.Zipporah Kuria, a British citizen whose father also died in the Ethiopian crash, pointed to the recent disclosure in a Senate committee report that Boeing representatives coached FAA test pilots reviewing Boeing updates to the Max flightcontrol system.Boeing leadership is still riddled with deceit. Their priorities are not on consumer safety, she said in an interview.Boeing spokesman Bernard Choi said the company learned many hard lessons from the crashes and is committed to safety.We continue to work closely with global regulators and our customers to support the safe return of the fleet to service around the world, Choi said.The return of the plane to U.S. skies is a huge boost for Boeing, which has lost billions during the Max grounding because it has been unable to deliver new planes to airline customers. Orders for the plane have plunged. Boeing has removed more than 1,000 Max jets from its backlog because airlines canceled orders or the sales are not certain to go through because of the pandemic crisis gripping the travel industry.',\n",
       " 'Chinese regulators have ordered Ant Group, the worlds largest financial technology company, to rectify its businesses and comply with regulatory requirements amid increased scrutiny of antimonopoly practices in the countrys internet sector.The Peoples Bank of China, the countrys central bank, summoned Ant executives on Saturday and ordered them to formulate a rectification plan and an implementation timetable of its business, including its credit, insurance and wealth management services, the regulators said in a statement Sunday.The statement said that Ant Group lacked a sound governance mechanism, defied regulatory compliance requirements and engaged in regulatory arbitrage. It also said that the company used its market position to exclude rivals and hurt the rights and interests of consumers.The meeting came after Chinese regulators last month halted Ants 37 billion stock debut in Shanghai and Hong Kong over regulatory changes, and comes just days after China announced an antimonopoly investigation of ecommerce giant Alibaba Group, which owns a 33 stake in Ant Group.The orders from regulators could limit Ant Groups expansion and throw its lucrative finance businesses into disarray.Ant Group, which started out as a payments services for Alibabas ecommerce platform Taobao, has since expanded to offer insurance and investment products to its hundreds of millions of users in mainland China. Jack Ma, the founder of both Alibaba and Ant Group, is one of Chinas richest and most prominent entrepreneurs.Regulators ordered Ant Group to establish a financial holding company and hold sufficient capital. They also said that Ant Group should return to its payments origins, enhance transparency around transactions and prohibit unfair competition, while improving corporate governance and ensuring that it complies with regulatory requirements for its businesses.Ant Group said in a statement Sunday that it would comply with regulatory requirements and enhance risk management and control, and that a working group would be set up to make the necessary rectifications.We appreciate financial regulators guidance and help, the statement said. The rectification is an opportunity for Ant Group to strengthen the foundation for our business to grow with full compliance, and to continue focusing on innovating for social good and serving small businesses.The scrutiny of Ant Group and Alibaba comes as China closely examines the influence of the countrys internet sector.Last month, China released draft regulations to clamp down on anticompetitive practices in the industry, such as signing exclusive agreements with merchants and the use of subsidies to squeeze out competitors.Alibaba and a company spun off by Tencent Holding Ltd. were fined this month for failing to apply for official approval before proceeding with some acquisitions.Last Tuesday, regulators met with executives of Alibaba and five other major Chinese internet companies and warned them not to abuse their dominance to drive out competitors through use of exclusive contracts, predatory pricing and other tactics, according to a statement by the State Administration of Market Regulation.',\n",
       " 'Chinese consumers are expected to spend tens of billions on everything from fresh food to luxury goods during this years Singles Day online shopping festival, as the country recovers from the pandemic.The shopping festival, which is the worlds largest and falls on Nov. 11 every year, is an annual extravaganza where Chinas ecommerce companies, including Alibaba, JD.com and Pinduoduo, offer generous discounts on their platforms. Last year, shoppers spent 38.4 billion on Alibabas ecommerce platforms Tmall and Taobao.The shopping festival got its name as it falls on Nov. 11 every year. Also known as 11.11 or Double 11, the numbers look like bare branches, an expression referring to those who are single and unattached in China. The day thus later became known as Singles Day.This years festival will be closely watched as a barometer of consumption in China, which is just beginning to bounce back from the coronavirus pandemic after months of lockdown earlier in the year.Analysts expect Chinese consumers to spend more on imported products and foreign luxury brands, since many Chinese tourists were unable to travel internationally due to the coronavirus pandemic and tightened travel restrictions.A survey by consulting firm Oliver Wyman found that 86 of Chinese consumers are willing to spend the same as or more than during last years Singles Day festival.In the last six months or so, wealthy households have actually spent more money, said Sean Shen, customer and strategy competence leader for EY in Greater China. We also see that purchases of luxury segment products are increasing because of the international travel restrictions.In 2018, Chinese consumers spent about 770 billion yuan (116.3 billion) on luxury items, accounting for about a third of the global spend, with each luxuryconsuming household spending an average of 80,000 yuan annually (12,089), according to a 2019 McKinsey report on luxury.Sales of electronic goods and health and wellness products are also expected to rise, as more people work from home and pay more attention to their health amid the pandemic, according to a report by consultancy Bain  Company.To help merchants cope with the impact from the coronavirus, online platforms have extended the shopping festival period this year in hopes of boosting sales.Both Alibaba and JD.com, the countrys two biggest ecommerce companies, began offering discounts on Oct. 21, three weeks ahead of Nov. 11. Some brands and merchants that slashed their prices booked hundreds of millions of yuan (tens of millions of dollars) in sales just hours into the shopping festival.Tang Chenghui, an electrical engineer who lives in Beijing sees Singles Day as an opportunity to stock up on snacks and imported products such as milk from Australia. Ahead of the festival, Tang preordered 3 boxes of duck eggs, 10 packets of soybean milk powder, two boxes of yogurt, coffee and wine.Im buying more snacks this year because Ive just moved into a new apartment and have enough storage space to stockpile the snacks I like, said Tang. Some of these products are really cheap during the Singles Day discounts.Unlike Black Friday and Cyber Monday in the U.S., Singles Day in China is not just about deep bargains. Alibaba pioneered the concept of Singles Day and holds an annual gala on Nov. 11 with celebrity performances to entertain shoppers.Ecommerce companies dont break down Singles Day sales volume by brands so it is hard to know what share goes to foreign companies, though some companies might announce their own performances.Sales via livestreaming and Alibabas annual gala are part of a shoppertainment trend which blends shopping with entertainment in order to become more appealing and engaging to shoppers.Mini games within online shopping platforms entice shoppers with deeper discounts while encouraging them to spend more time within the app.Because of COVID19, brands and retailers have doubled down on ecommerce and livestreaming commerce to drive growth, and it will show strongly on (Singles Day) this year, said Wang Xiaofeng, a senior analyst at Forrester.But while millions of shoppers spend hours on mini games hoping to snag better bargains, some are irked by the complexities required to win such discounts.Black Friday discounts tend to be better, and they are more straightforward, said Liu Zhirou, a 27 yearold Beijingbased accountant. Now, I still ask my friends to help me buy things from the U.S. during Black Friday.The rules around Singles Day discounts now are getting more and more complicated, she said. I usually just spend my money on Black Friday, and buy less on Singles Day.',\n",

Imports rose 4.7 by value to 178.7 billion, decelerating from the previous months 13.2 surge, though volumes of some goods increased.Chinas exporters have benefited from the relatively early reopening of the secondlargest global economy and demand for masks and other medical supplies. That has allowed them to take market share from foreign competitors that are hampered by antidisease controls.Exports for the first 10 months of 2020 rose 0.5 over the same period a year earlier to 2 trillion, the first positive yeartodate figure. Exports have been bigger than the same month a year earlier since April, but after the first quarters 13.3 contraction, total growth for 2020 was in negative territory until now.In October, exports to the United States in October gained 22.5 over a year ago to 43.8 billion, up from the previous months 20.5 growth. Imports of American goods jumped 33.4 to 12.5 billion, an increase from Septembers 24.5 growth.Chinas monthly global trade surplus swelled 35.8 over a year earlier to 58.4 billion, one of its biggest on record.The politically sensitive trade gap with the United States expanded 18.5 to 31.4 billion.China is on track to become the only major economy to grow this year while activity in the United States, Europe and Japan shrinks.Chinas economy shrank by 6.8 from a year earlier in the first three months of 2020 after factories, shops and offices were shut down to fight the virus. Growth rebounded to 3.2 in the second quarter and accelerated to 4.9 in the three months ending in September.Automakers and other large manufacturers are back to normal activity, helping to drive demand for imported iron ore, copper and other industrial materials. Retail sales have rebounded to above previrus levels, rising 0.5 over a year earlier in the quarter ending in September.Imports have fallen by value after weak demand caused prices of oil and other commodities to plunge. But volumes of foreign food and other goods bought by Chinese factories and consumers have risen.Imports of crude oil rose 10.6 by volume over a year earlier in the first nine months of 2020 but fell 24.5 by value, according to customs data. Grain imports rose 28.5 by volume but only 21 by value.Exports to the 27nation European Union fell 21 in October to 22.7 billion. Imports of European goods sank 20.4 to 33.6 billion.

Debuting at No. 3 was Zhong Shanshan, chairman of bottled water brand Nongfu Spring, with 53.7 billion following his companys Hong Kong stock market debut in September.Rising share prices created an average of five new Chinese entrepreneurs worth at least 1 billion every week over the past year, according to Huruns founder, Rupert Hoogewerf.The world has never seen this much wealth created in just one year, said Hoogewerf in a statement. Chinas entrepreneurs have done much better than expected. Despite Covid19 they have risen to record levels.The richest woman on the list was Yang Huiyan of real estate developer Country Garden. She was No. 6 at 33 billion, up 29 from last year.Rankings of Chinas richest change abruptly from year to year as real estate, technology and other industries rise and fall in the fastevolving economy.This year, the coronavirus boosted the fortunes of Alibabas Ma and other internet entrepreneurs as the shutdown of the Chinese economy to fight the virus propelled demand for online shopping and business tools.Eric Yuan of Californiabased video conference platform Zoom rose more than 10 billion to 16.2 billion. Li Yongxin of Offcn, an online work training platform, more than doubled to 20.6 billion. Chen Xiangdong of tutoring platform Genshuixue rose eightfold to 11.8 billion.Ma, 56, retired as Alibaba chairman last year and also is a shareholder in Ant Group, a payments service spun off from Alibaba. It is preparing for a public share offering after being valued at 150 billion in a 2017 private financing round, which will add to Mas fortune.Entrepreneurs in electric cars, an industry the ruling Communist Party is promoting, also saw their fortunes swell.Zeng Yuqun of battery producer CATL tripled to 17.6 billion.

       " 'The owner of TikTok has chosen Oracle over Microsoft as the American tech partner that could help keep the popular videosharing app running in the U.S., according to a source familiar with the deal who was not authorized to speak publicly about it.Microsoft announced Sunday that its bid to acquire TikToks U.S. operations was rejected, removing the tech giant from the running a week before President Donald Trump promises to follow through with a plan to ban the Chineseowned app in the U.S. over spying concerns.TikTok and the White House declined to comment Sunday. Oracle didnt return a request for comment but has previously declined comment.Walmart, which had planned to partner with Microsoft on the acquisition, said Sunday it continues to have an interest in a TikTok investment and is talking about it with ByteDance and other parties.The Trump administration has threatened to ban TikTok by Sept. 20 and ordered ByteDance to sell its U.S. business, claiming nationalsecurity risks due to its Chinese ownership. The government worries about user data being funneled to Chinese authorities. TikTok denies it is a nationalsecurity risk and is suing to stop the administration from the threatened ban.Its not clear if the proposed deal will only cover TikToks U.S. business, and, if so, how it will be split from the rest of TikToks social media platform, which is popular worldwide. ByteDance also owns a similar video app, Douyin, for the Chinese market.Any deal must still be reviewed by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS, a U.S. government group chaired by the Treasury Secretary that studies mergers for nationalsecurity reasons. The president can approve or deny a transaction recommended by the panel, though Trump has already voiced support for Oracle as a great company that could handle the acquisition.Microsoft said in a Sunday statement that ByteDance let us know today they would not be selling TikToks US operations to Microsoft.Microsoft added it was confident our proposal would have been good for TikToks users, while protecting national security interests. The company said it would have made significant changes to ensure the service met the highest standards for security, privacy, online safety, and combating disinformation.TikTok, which says it has 100 million U.S. users and about 700 million globally, is known for its fun, goofy videos of dancing, lipsyncing, pranks and jokes. Its recently become home to more political content such as the comedian Sarah Cooper, who drew a large audience by lipsyncing Trumps own oftendisjointed statements from public appearances.But the app has also raised concerns because of its Chinese ownership. The White House has cracked down on a range of Chinese businesses, including telecom equipment makers Huawei and ZTE and messaging app WeChat, over worries that they would enable Chinese authorities to get U.S. user data. Republican and Democratic lawmakers have raised concerns about censorship and childrens privacy.TikTok denies that it has shared user data with the Chinese government or that it would do so if asked. The company says it has not censored videos at the request of Chinese authorities and insists it is not a nationalsecurity threat.TikTok has sued to stop the ban, but not the sale order. The negotiations have been complicated by several factors, including Trumps repeated demands that the U.S. government should get a cut of any deal, a stipulation and role for the president that experts say is unprecedented.In addition, the Chinese government in late August unveiled new regulations that restrict exports of technology, likely including the artificial intelligence system TikTok uses to choose which videos to spool up to its users. That means ByteDance would have to obtain a license from China to export such technology to a foreign company.The deal had come together rapidly after the administration ramped up its threats against TikTok this summer, despite TikToks efforts to put distance between its app and its Chinese ownership. It installed former Disney executive Kevin Mayer as its American CEO, but he resigned in August after just a few months on the job, saying the political environment has sharply changed.Both Microsoft and Oracle are known more for their business software offerings than for those intended for consumers.Oracle primarily makes database software. It competes with tech giants such as Microsoft and Amazon that provide cloud services as well as businesssoftware specialists like Salesforce.Some analysts see Oracles interest in a consumer business as misguided. Oracle should focus on enterprisemarket acquisitions and not invest in a consumer app like TikTok that doesnt fit with the rest of its business, said Jefferies analyst Brent Thill, who compares the idea to Delta Airlines buying a motorcycle company. It doesnt make any sense, he said.Thill suggested that TikTok competitors like Facebook and Snapchat should be cheering on Oracle as a buyer, because Oracle wouldnt add a lot of value to the app.Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison is unusual among tech executives for his public support of President Donald Trump, hosting a fundraiser for him in February at his Rancho Mirage, California, estate. The company also hired a former top aide to Vice President Mike Pence its CEO, Safra Catz, also served on Trumps transition team.The president said on Aug. 18 that Oracle was a great company that could handle buying TikTok.

We have saved Rs 2 per liter while bringing it by the pipeline,\" NOC Spokesperson Binit Mani Upadhyaya said as the NOC marked a year of bringing oil by the pipeline on Wednesday.He revealed that the country imported 534,103,000 liters in the past one year and there was a saving of Rs 1,068,206,000 at the rate of Rs 2 every liter.Chief of the Amlekhgunj Depot of NOC Bharat Regmi said even the quantity of import has increased in the last year.The depots in Bhairahawa, Amlekhgunj and Biratnagar earlier used to separately bring petroleum products in tankers themselves. The oil for the whole country now comes to Amlekhgunj through the pipeline. Regmi said bringing oil through the pipeline instead of tankers also reduces pollution due to lack of emission by the tankers. Prime ministers (PM) of Nepal and India had inaugurated the MotihariAmlekhgunj petroleum pipeline from their respective residences last year. PM KP Sharma Oli and his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi had inaugurated the pipeline by simultaneously pushing the buttons from Kathmandu and New Delhi respectively. While the button pushed by Modi had sent diesel from Motihari, that pushed by Oli received it.The pipeline can operate round the clock and can bring up to 294 kiloliters of petroleum products per hour.',\n",
       " 'Pakistan is seeking the reversal of a 5.8 billion penalty imposed by an international tribunal for denying a mining lease to an Australian company, saying that paying the fine would hinder its handling of the coronavirus pandemic.The Reko Diq district in southwestern Pakistans Baluchistan province is famed for its mineral wealth, including gold and copper. Prime Minister Imran Khans government considers it a strategic national asset, though instead of yielding a bonanza the Reko Diq mining project may cost the country dearly.The World Banks International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes is considering Pakistans appeal against enforcing the penalty over its cancellation of the Reko Diq mining lease for Tethyan Copper Corp., a 5050 joint venture of Barrick Gold Corp. of Australia and Antofagasto PLC of Chile.In the meantime, the Baluchistan government has set up its own company to develop the mine As prices for commodities surge, with gold recently at more than 2,000 an ounce, turning fiasco to fortune is all the more appealing.Pakistan and Tethyan both have signaled a willingness to discuss alternative solutions, such as a settlement, but the status of any talks on a deal is unclear. Officials on the Pakistan side said they have not been in direct contact and no specific settlement has been proposed.Despite the initiation of arbitral proceedings in order to protect its rights, TCC remains hopeful of an opportunity to reach a negotiated resolution to the case, says a statement on the companys website issued after the 2019 arbitration ruling.Asked recently, Tethyan officials said there were no updates.An official in Pakistans attorney generals office said an out of court settlement with Tethyan Copper Corp. , or TCC, was possible pending a final decision on the award, which might not come until next year.The Reko Diq case is testing Khans ability to use back channel diplomacy to settle disputes and keep alive efforts to lure more foreign investors.According to details available on Tethyans website, the Reko Diq Mining Project was to build and operate a world class coppergold openpit mine at a cost of about 3.3 billion. The project could be a beacon for further investment into exploration and mining sectors in Baluchistan and Pakistan in general, the company said.Tethyan says its 1998 agreement with the local Baluchistan government entitled it to the mining lease, subject only to routine government requirements.After an extensive and detailed feasibility study, the companys local subsidiary submitted a mining lease application in 2011. The project stalled in November 2011 when the Baluchistan provincial government rejected the application.Pakistani officials in both Islamabad, the capital, and Baluchistan say the mining lease was terminated by the Baluchistan government because it was secured in a nontransparent manner and granted too many concessions to the company, violating government rules and regulations and ignoring national interests.By then, Tethyan had invested 220 million in Reko Diq. The Australian mining company sought help from the World Bank arbitration tribunal in 2012, and it ruled against Pakistan in 2017, rejecting an earlier decision against Tethyan by the Pakistan Supreme Court.The miner originally sought 8.5 billion. The tribunal opted to use a formula for calculating damages for the cancelled lease based on the assumed profits Tethyan might have earned from the mine over 56 years, said an official at the Justice Ministry who spoke on condition he not be named because he was not authorized to speak to media about the case.The resulting fine, of nearly 6 billion including the damages award and interest, is equal to about 2 of Pakistans GDP and is on a par with a recently agreed upon bailout package for Pakistan from the International Monetary Fund.Economist Jeffrey Sachs described it as a mugging of Pakistan. Other experts also have questioned the reasoning behind huge award, which is more than double the size of the largest similar arbitration award, in the case between Dow Chemical and Kuwait Petrochemical Corp.Documents explaining the award suggest one intention was to penalize Pakistan for having violated its investment treaty with Australia.Regardless, paying compensation equivalent to 40 of the countrys foreign exchange reserves would be a challenge as the impoverished Islamic nation struggles to revive its economy. The pandemic has infected nearly 300,000 of Pakistans 212 million people and killed more than 6,300, while the economy contracted for the first time in decades in the fiscal year that ended in June.Reko Diqs proximity to the Saindak copper mine operated by Minmetals Corp. of China has raised speculation that Pakistan might tap help from Beijing in resolving the problem if its latest effort to get the award revoked fails.Baluchistans Gwardar port is an anchor in the China Pakistan Economic Corridor, part of Beijings vast Belt and Road infrastructure initiative.Minmetals chairman, Guo Wenqing, met with Khan, the prime minister, in Beijing last year. But both Pakistani officials involved in the Reko Diq project and Minmentals said there is no discussion of a bailout by China.Mahfooz Ali Khan, who retired as finance secretary in Baluchistan province, told The AP the regional government initially agreed to the project hoping to see the mine developed but cancelled after it found rules had been violated.I personally feel that both sides should consider an out of court settlement as both sides have solid legal points to continue a legal battle, but it would be better if they renegotiate and resume work on the project, he said.',\n",
       " 'Zoom Video Communications is rapidly emerging as the latest internet gold mine as millions of people flock to its conferencing service to see colleagues, friends and family while tethered to their homes during the pandemic.Tuesdays release of the onceobscure companys financial results for the FebruaryApril period provided a window into the astronomical growth that has turned it into a Wall Street star.Zooms revenue for its fiscal firstquarter more than doubled from the same time last year to 328 million, resulting a profit of 27 million  up from just 198,000 a year ago.The numbers exceeded analysts already heightened expectations, providing another lift to a rocketing stock that has more than tripled in price so far this year while the benchmark Standard  Poors 500 index has fallen 5.After a big runup leading up to Tuesdays highly anticipated announcement, Zooms stock initially rose even higher in extended trading. But it abruptly reversed course and fell more than 3 after company executives acknowledged during a video discussion that some of its newfound users might depart during the second half of the year if health worries caused by the novel corornavirus dissipate.Even if the shares trade in similar fashion during Wednesdays regular session, the stock will still be hovering around 200  more than five times the companys initial public offering price of 36 less than 14 months ago.The surge left Zoom with a market value of about 59 billion through Tuesday  greater than the combined market values of the four largest U.S. airlines, which have seen their businesses hammered by the coronavirus outbreak that has dramatically curtailed travel.Videoconferencing is going to become a mainstream service, predicted Zoom CEO Eric Yuan, who cofounded the company nine years ago. He made the remarks during the video conference that at one point attracted more than 3,000 participants, a reflection of the intense interest in the company and its hot stock.In a sign that the company still expects phenomenal growth in the months ahead, Zoom forecast revenue of roughly 500 million for its current quarter ending in July, more than quadrupling from the same time last year. For its full fiscal year, Zoom now expects revenue of about 1.8 billion, nearly tripling in a year.Zooms boom has come despite privacy and security problems that enabled outsiders to make uninvited  and sometimes crude  appearances during other peoples video conferences.The concerns prompted some schools to stop using Zoom for online classes that have become widespread since February, although the companys efforts to introduce more security protection has brought some back to the service. More than 100,000 schools worldwide are now using Zoom for online classes, according to the company.Overall, Zoom now has more than 300 million daily participants attending a meeting held on its service, up from 10 million five months ago. Those numbers include people who join multiple Zoom meetings during the same day, something that has been happening more recently in recent months.But the onceweak privacy controls also helped make Zoom extremely easy to use, one of the reasons it became such a popular way to hold online classes, business meetings and virtual cocktail hours after most of the U.S. began ordering people to stay at home in effort to reduce the spread of the coronavirus that causes COVID19.Zoom also offers a free version of its service, another factor in its popularity at a time when about 40 million people in the U.S. have lost their jobs since midMarch, raising the specter of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s.The San Jose, California, company has always made most of its money from companies that subscribe to a more sophisticated version of its service that traditionally has been used for business meetings among employees working in offices far apart from each other.But the pandemicdriven shutdown turned Zoom into a tool for employees who once worked alongside each other, but have been doing their jobs from home during the past few months.Zoom ended April with 265,400 corporate customers with at least 10 employees, more than quadrupling from the same time last year. About 30 of the companys revenue in the most recent quarter came from users with fewer than 10 employees, up from 20 in the NovemberJanuary period.Although Zoom remains focused on servicing its corporate customers, Yuan is hoping to figure out ways to make money from the all the socializing and learning that is happening on the service, too. Some analysts have speculated that eventually may involve showing ads on the free version of Zoom, although the company hasnt given any indication it will do that. There are a lot of opportunities ahead of us, Yuan said in Tuesdays video conference without elaborating.If it hopes to continue to expand, Zoom also will also will likely have to do a better job of protecting the privacy of its video conferences. To help achieve that goal, Yuan has been consulting since April with Alex Stamos, a highly respected online security expert who previously worked at Yahoo and Facebook. Both those companies encountered their only security and privacy problems, too.Zooms success is also drawing stiffer competition from much larger companies, including Microsoft, Google and Facebook.',\n",
       " 'China, the worlds biggest energy consumer, is building up stockpiles of crude oil as global prices plunge due to the coronavirus outbreak.Imports rose 4.5 in March over a year earlier even as the worlds secondlargest economy shut down to fight the virus and demand collapsed. For the first quarter of the year imports were up 5.The price collapse is battering stateowned oil producers and possibly disrupting official plans to develop the industry but is a boon to Chinese drivers and factories. It gives Beijing a chance to add to a strategic petroleum reserve that is meant to insulate the country against possible supply disruptions.In the midst of all this, China oil imports have been resilient, as low prices have enabled stockpiling, said Peter Lee, senior oil and gas analyst for Fitch Solutions.As global prices fell, Chinese importers sent 84 tankers to Saudi Arabia in midMarch, each able to carry 2 million barrels of crude, according to news reports that cited the China Shipbuilding Industry Association.Low oil prices have a positive impact on China, said the ruling Communist Partys Political and Legal Commission on its social media account.Still, the plunge threatens to disrupt plans to make China more energy selfreliant if stateowned drillers have to cut spending on developing domestic oilfields, said industry analyst Max Petrov of Wood Mackenzie.Stateowned PetroChina Ltd., Asias biggest producer, is probably losing quite serious amounts of money, said Petrov. He said PetroChina has to decide whether to follow the lead of Western producers and slash spending on new wells.If it cuts investment, and because of the nature of Chinas oilfields, it will take a very long time for production to come back up, said Petrov. It will take years and even more money.Beijing also appears to be adding to its strategic stockpile, though details are secret.The Cabinets National Energy Administration reported in September that total reserves held by the government and oil companies were equal to 80 days of consumption.The official reserve stands at about 385 million barrels, according to Lee of Fitch Solutions. He said plans appear to call for increasing that to 500 to 600 million barrels.If enough additional storage capacity is built, the government might import 500,000 to 900,000 barrels per day for the strategic reserve, or 5 to 9 of Chinas total foreign purchases, according to Lee.The government reserve uses three tank farms and state media say a fourth might be under construction.The energy administration referred questions to the Cabinets planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission. The NDRC didnt respond Wednesday.The Communist Party commission said the plunge in prices gives Beijing a unique chance to build up that reserve but gave no indication the government was doing that.This is a onceacentury opportunity! the commission said.That might be hard to do, because like other countries China is running out of empty storage capacity, said Lei Sun of Wood Mackenzie.The strategic reserve and private suppliers had filled up at least 85 percent of their total storage capacity by February and added more oil in March, according to Lei. He said space that is left might be filled up with crude bought earlier at higher prices that Chinese buyers are forced to accept even though they had no customers.I dont think there is going to be any leftover space for crude, said Lei.Cheaper crude is one of Chinas few economic bright spots in the coronavirus pandemic.The economy suffered its worst contraction since the mid60s in the first quarter, shrinking 6.8 from a year earlier after Beijing closed factories and told some 800 million people to stay home.Forecasters expect little to no growth this year, down from 2019s 6.1, which already was a multidecade low.That is politically risky for the ruling party, which bases its claim to power on associating itself with Chinas economic success.Chinas two other major stateowned oil companies  Sinopec Ltd. and CNOOC  also are believed to be considering cuts in investment.China has relied increasingly on imported oil and gas since the late 1990s as manufacturing, car ownership and airline travel boomed.Imports make up about half of consumption. Half of that comes from the Middle East and the rest from Russia, Southeast Asia and Africa.The ruling party wants to curb that reliance, which communist leaders see as a security risk. That is a major factor behind Beijings multibilliondollar investments in hydro, wind and solar power.',\n",
       " 'The world is awash in oil, theres little demand for it and were running out of places to put it.That in a nutshell explains Mondays strange and unprecedented action in the market for crude oil futures contracts, where traders essentially offered to pay someone else to deal with the oil they were due to have delivered next month.The price of U.S. benchmark crude that would be delivered in May was selling for around 15 a barrel Monday morning, but fell as low as 40 per barrel during the day. It was the first time that the price on a futures contract for oil has gone negative, analysts say.Its the worst oil price in history, which shouldnt surprise us, because its the inevitable result of the biggest supply and demand disparity in history, said Ryan Sitton, commissioner at the Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates the states oil industry.Theres little mystery as to why theres so little demand for oil Efforts to limit the spread of the coronavirus have major cities around the world on lockdown, air travel has been seriously curtailed, and millions of people are working from home, leading to far fewer commuters on the roads.But pumps are still running, extracting oil from the ground, and all that oil has to go somewhere. Here are some questions and answers about the latest developments in the oil patchHAS THE PRICE OF OIL EVER GONE NEGATIVE BEFORESometimes, the price on the future delivery of oil will get skewed by a surprise event, say an oil pipeline bursts. That can cause the price of a futures contract for a given month to be sharply higher or lower than that of the futures contract for the next month.Usually, this is smoothed out by the market, but the sharp pullback in demand combined with a glut of oil has led to a dearth of oil storage capacity. That made it hard for traders with contracts for crude delivery in May to find buyers, which sent the contract price into negative territory.This has never happened before, not even close, said Tim Bray, senior portfolio manager at GuideStone Capital Management in Dallas. Weve never seen a negative price on a futures contract for oil.ARE OIL COMPANIES PAYING PEOPLE TO TAKE AWAY THEIR CRUDEWhile some companies may be paying others to take away their crude oil, that does not appear to be widespread.Many analysts described the dip in crude oil prices as technical, related to the way futures contracts are written. Most buyers are currently purchasing oil that would be delivered in June, not May.Even so, there were more than 150,000 of those futures contracts that traded hands, enough volume to make it meaningful, said Ryan Fitzmaurice, energy strategist at Rabobank.In my view, todays move was more technical in nature and related to the futures contract expiration, Fitzmaurice said. We could see isolated incidents where oil companies pay people to take their oil away as storage and pipeline capacity become scarce but that is unlikely on a sustained basis.WHATS GOING ON WITH OIL STORAGEWith far less gasoline and jet fuel being consumed, oil tanks are starting to fill up. Experts have been warning that global storage could fill up in late April or early May.Thats led some producers to decide to move oil now, because the space may become more valuable than the oil, Sitton said.Theres so much oversupply, and storage is fulling up, Sitton said. Eventually you go to a point where literally theres so much of a valuable commodity in the world that the commodity no longer has value. And thats what were seeing.WHERE WILL THE OIL GOWith many oil tanks filling up, the federal government is negotiating with companies to store crude oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. But if all the storage tanks are full, oil companies will begin shutting in wells, which can damage oil fields. Many tankers are full of oil and floating at sea.WHY DIDNT THE OPEC DEAL FIX THISEarlier this month, OPEC and its allies, with political pressure from the U.S. government, agreed to cut production by nearly 10 million barrels per day  about 10 of current global output. But some analysts feel the deal didnt go far enough to curb massive oversupply. It kept prices from falling farther for the time being, but theres still too much oil in the world.HOW WILL THIS AFFECT THE PRICE OF GASOLINECheap oil leads to cheaper prices at the pump, which are often viewed as a boon for consumers. The average price in the U.S. for a gallon of regular gasoline fell to about 1.49 or less, more than 1 less than a year ago, according to AAA. But this time around, its not good for anybody, said Jim Burkhard, vice president at IHS Markit.Typically when oil prices fall, gasoline prices fall and that benefits consumers, Burkhard said. But prices are falling today because hardly anyone driving, theyre driving a lot, lot less. So its difficult for anyone to take advantage of these lower gasoline prices if theyre not driving. So theres no winner in this situation today. ',\n",
       " 'OPEC, Russia and other oilproducing nations on Sunday finalized an unprecedented production cut of nearly 10 million barrels, or a tenth of global supply, in hopes of boosting crashing prices amid the coronavirus pandemic and a price war, officials said.This could be the largest reduction in production from OPEC for perhaps a decade, maybe longer, said U.S. Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette, who credited President Donald Trumps personal involvement in getting dueling parties to the table and helping to end a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia.Oil prices have collapsed as the coronavirus and the COVID19 illness it causes have largely halted global travel and slowed down other energychugging sectors such as manufacturing. It has devastated the oil industry in the U.S., which now pumps more crude than any other country.But some producers have been reluctant to ease supply. The cartel and other nations on Sunday agreed to allow Mexico to cut only 100,000 barrels a month, a sticking point for an accord initially reached Friday after a marathon video conference between 23 nations. The nations together agreed to cut 9.7 million barrels a day throughout May and June.The group reached the deal just hours before Asian markets reopened Monday and as international benchmark Brent crude traded at just over 31 a barrel and American shale producers struggle.Video aired by the Saudiowned satellite channel AlArabiya showed the moment that Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, a son of King Salman, assented to the deal.I go with the consent, so I agree, the prince said, chuckling, drawing a round of applause from those on the video call.But it had not been smiles and laughs for weeks after the socalled OPEC+ group of OPEC members and other nations failed in March to reach an agreement on production cuts, sending prices tumbling. Saudi Arabia sharply criticized Russia days earlier over what it described as comments critical of the kingdom, which finds itself trying to appease Trump, a longtime OPEC critic.Even U.S. senators had warned Saudi Arabia to find a way to boost prices as American shale firms face farhigher production costs. American troops had been deployed to the kingdom for the first time since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks over concerns of Iranian retaliation amid regional tensions.Theyve spent over the last month waging war on American oil producers while we are defending theirs. This is not how friends treat friends, said Sen. Kevin Cramer, a Republican from North Dakota, before the OPEC+ deal.U.S. producers have already been reducing output. The American Petroleum Institute lauded Sundays global pact, saying it will help get other nations stateowned oil production to follow the lead of U.S. producers that are trying to adjust to plunging demand.Brouillette said the U.S. did not make commitments of its own production cuts, but was able to show the obvious  that plunging demand because of the pandemic is expected to slash U.S. oil production.Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh also told state television that Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates would cut another 2 million barrels of oil a day between them atop the OPEC+ deal. The three countries did not immediately acknowledge the cut themselves, though Zanganeh attended the video conference.Officials said other planned cuts would stand in the deal, meaning an 8 million barrel per day cut from July through the end of the year and a 6 million barrel cut for 16 months beginning in 2021.This will enable the rebalancing of the oil markets and the expected rebound of prices by 15 per barrel in the short term, said a statement from Nigerias oil ministry.Mexico had initially blocked the deal but its president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, had said Friday that he had agreed with Trump that the U.S. will compensate what Mexico cannot add to the proposed cuts.The big Oil Deal with OPEC Plus is done. This will save hundreds of thousands of energy jobs in the United States, Trump said in a tweet. I would like to thank and congratulate President Putin of Russia and King Salman of Saudi Arabia.The Kremlin said President Vladimir Putin held a joint call with Trump and Saudi King Salman to express support of the deal. It also said Putin spoke separately with Trump about the oil market and other issues.Analysts offered cautious praise.The pure size of the cut is unprecedented, but, then again, so is the impact the coronavirus is having on demand, said Mohammed Ghulam, an energy analyst at Raymond James.But Ghulam and others worried it may not be enough.This is at least a temporary relief for the energy industry and for the global economy. This industry is too big to be let to fail and the alliance showed responsibility with this agreement, said Per Magnus Nysveen, the head of analysis at Rystad Energy. Even though the production cuts are smaller than what the market needed and only postpone the stock building constraints problem, the worst is for now avoided.',\n",
       " 'Telecom service provider Ncell has cleared all the capital gain tax on its sale on Sunday.It has paid Rs 14.33 billion on Friday, according to the Large Taxpayers Office. \"We are still in bank. Payment is being made. Ncell has paid Rs 14.33 billion,\" Chief Tax Administrator at the office Jhalak Ram Adhikari told Setopati.SwedishFinnish company TeliaSonera had not paid capital gain tax for sale of its 80 stake in Ncell to Malaysian company Axiata in April 2015.The Large Taxpayers Office earlier had determined that TeliaSonera had made capital gain of Rs 143.65 billion during the sale.The extended full bench of Supreme Court (SC) headed by Cholendra Shumsher Rana on February 6, 2019 had ordered that the capital gain tax be recovered from Ncell and Axiata. The full bench including Justices Meera Khadka, Bishwambhar Shrestha, Ananda Mohan Bhattarai and Tanka Moktan hearing a petition filed by Dwarika Nath Dhungel demanding the capital gain tax be recovered from Ncell on February 6 had issued a mandamus ruling that Ncell and Axiata should pay the tax.The mandamus reasoned that Ncell has to pay capital gain tax to the Nepal government despite TeliaSonera selling the shares to Axiata as its business is based in Nepal.The Large Taxpayers Office on April 16, 2019 had determined that Ncell must pay Rs 62.63 billion in capital gain tax including interest and late fine, and stated that Ncell need to pay Rs 39.06 billion more.Ncell, that had already deposited Rs 23.57 billion in two installments, then moved the SC claiming that it should pay only Rs 14.365 billion more. It had pointed that the SC has just ordered to recover capital gain tax, and not interest and late fine. It added that it should pay 25 percent of the capital gain of Rs 143.65 billion during the sale which comes out at Rs 35.91 billion.A full bench of Justices Tej Bahadur KC, Purushottam Bhandari, Dambar Bahadur Shahi, Sushma Lata Mathema and Manoj Kumar Sharma on August 26, 2019 had ordered that the fine component on the determined amount should not be recovered from Ncell.The SC had also revoked the writ petition filed by Ncell against the Large Taxpayers Office. \"The amount determined by the Large Taxpayers Office on April 16 has been revoked so far as the fee levied on the applicant as per clause 120(a) as it seems to be against the clause since the tax liability on Axiata Ncell was created only after the court imposed the liability of capital gain tax on Axiata Ncell and ruled that it should be recovered from the company. The claims of the applicant on other issues, apart from that, has been revoked,\" the SC verdict on August 26 stated.The SC on November 21, 2019 then calculated the revoked late fine component of the capital gain tax determined by the Large Taxpayers Office to be Rs 17,956,713,000, and stated that Ncell should only pay Rs 21,103,971,000 more.Ncell then paid Rs 4.50 billion on December 31, 2019 and Rs 4.60 billion on March 31. It has cleared all the outstanding capital gain tax including interest with payment of Rs 14.33 billion on Sunday.Malaysian company Axiata had bought Reynolds Holding, which held a majority stake in Ncell, from the SwedishFinnish company TeliaSonera in April 2016.Reynolds Holding was TeliaSoneras whollyowned subsidiary, registered at Saint Kitts and Nevis, a tax haven. Though capital gains tax needs to be paid by the company that gains from the deal, TeliaSonera has already exited Nepal.',\n",

We can redirect the budget halting everything else. We are in a position to announce a package of over Rs 100 billion,\" he pointed. \"It will be late if the government waits to estimate the damages and then take decision. It should provide psychological support now.\"Pointing that the service sector, that makes a contribution of 60 percent to the gross domestic product (GDP), has been hardly hit by the pandemic and the resulting lockdown, he recommended the government to give an immediate moratorium of twothree months in paying taxes, fees and fines. \"The government can provide a rebate of 510 percent to those who paid tax last year. That will act as an incentive or relief to persons who are connected to the formal sector through tax.\"He suggested that bridging loans can be provided to firms with conditions that they do not lay off staffers. He pointed that those working in the organized sector can be helped by mobilizing the money remaining idle in the Social Security Fund. \"Clause 10(6) of the act about social security fund based on contribution has a provision of bringing unemployment assistance. The fund has billions of rupees.\"He stressed that the government should think about those working in the unorganized and informal sectors on daily wages. \"The PM Employment Program was criticized last year. It was used to dole out money to the party cadres for chasing away monkeys, cutting grass and other trivial things. Those working for daily wages can be given money through the program if it were operated in a meaningful way. There will be some meaningful work as well,\" he opined. \"Around Rs 25,000 can be given by making them work in accordance to the program concept of guaranteeing work for a minimum of 100 days.\"He also urged the government to think about the shrinking remittance income and ban on workers going abroad for employment. \"There is a welfare fund under the foreign employment act. The money in the fund can be used.\"He said the pandemic will create challenges for the next eight10 months and added that the government also has an opportunity to do some work. \"We economists say that Nepal has been pinned by the compulsion of being landlocked. But we have the opportunity of digitization now. We can take a huge leap in ecommerce, elearning and ebanking that was developing gradually until now.\"',\n",
       " 'Oil prices are plunging amid concern a dispute among producers could lead a global economy weakened by COVID19 to be awash in an oversupply of crude.Brent crude, the international standard, lost 11.44, or 25.3, to 33.83 per barrel in electronic trading in London. Benchmark U.S. crude fell 10.77, or 26.1, to 30.49.The dramatic losses follow a 10.1 drop for U.S. oil on Friday, which was its biggest loss in more than five years. Prices are falling as Saudi Arabia, Russia and other oilproducing countries argue how much to cut production in order to prop up prices.Demand for energy is falling as people cut back on travel. The worry is that the new coronavirus will slow economies sharply, meaning even less demand.Stephen Innes, chief markets strategist at AxiCorp, called reports that Saudi Arabia could increase its oil production in order to gain market share a shockandawe strategy.The oil market has seen arguments like this before. In 2014, OPEC held off production cuts in order to hold onto market share in the face of a resurgent U.S. oil industry. That led to oil to tumble from over 100 a barrel to below 40 by 2015.This most recent plummet for oil adds another punch to whats already been a brutal and dizzying couple weeks for financial markets worldwide. The U.S. stock market is down 12.2 since setting its record last month on worries about how much corporate profits will fall because of COVID19. Its set on Monday to mark the 11th anniversary of hitting bottom after the 2008 financial crisis.Treasury yields have plummeted to record lows as investors pile into anything that looks safe, almost regardless of how little it pays. The 10year Treasury yield pierced below 1 for the first time on Tuesday, only to breach 0.70 Friday.The virus usually leaves people with only mild to moderate symptoms, but because its new, experts cant say for sure how far it will ultimately spread and how much damage it will do, both to health and to the economy. The number of cases has reached 109,000 globally, and Italy on Sunday tried to quarantine a region holding more than a quarter of its population in hopes of corralling it.If the number of new infections slows in other parts of the world as it has in China, if the U.S. jobs market remains as solid as its been and if all the unease in markets ends up creating just a shortterm dip in confidence among shoppers, all this may recede quickly. But those are a lot of potential pain points.There are more ifs than at any other time in this 11year bull market, say strategists at BTIG.',\n",
       " 'Worldwide markets plummeted again Thursday, deepening a weeklong rout triggered by growing anxiety that the coronavirus will wreak havoc on the global economy. The sweeping selloff gave U.S. stocks their worst oneday drop since 2011.The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled nearly 1,200 points. The SP 500 has now plunged 12 from the alltime high it set just a week ago. That puts the index in what market watchers call a correction, which some analysts have said was long overdue in this bull market, the longest in history.Stocks are now headed for their worst week since October 2008, during the global financial crisis.The losses extended a slide that has wiped out the solid gains major indexes posted early this year. Investors came into 2020 feeling confident that the Federal Reserve would keep interest rates at low levels and the U.S.China trade war posed less of a threat to company profits after the two sides reached a preliminary agreement in January. Even in the early days of the outbreak, markets took things in stride.But over the past two weeks, a growing list of major companies issued warnings that profits could suffer as factory shutdowns across China disrupt supply chains and consumers there refrain from shopping. Travel to and from China is severely restricted, and shares of airlines, hotels and cruise operators have been punished in stock markets. As the virus spread beyond China, markets feared the economic issues in China could escalate globally.One sign of that is the big decline in oil prices, which slumped on expectations that demand will tail off sharply.This is a market thats being driven completely by fear, said Elaine Stokes, portfolio manager at Loomis Sayles, with market movements following the classic characteristics of a fear trade Stocks are down. Commodities are down, and bonds are up.Bond prices soared again Thursday as investors fled to safe investments. The yield on the benchmark 10year Treasury note fell as low as 1.246, a record low, according to TradeWeb. When yields fall, its a sign that investors are feeling less confident about the strength of the economy.Stokes said the swoon reminded her of the markets reaction following the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.Eventually were going to get to a place where this fear, its something that we get used to living with, the same way we got used to living with the threat of living with terrorism, she said. But right now, people dont know how or when were going to get there, and what people do in that situation is to retrench.The virus has now infected more than 82,000 people globally and is worrying governments with its rapid spread beyond the epicenter of China.Japan will close schools nationwide to help control the spread of the new virus. Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims from entering the kingdom to visit Islams holiest sites. Italy has become the center of the outbreak in Europe, with the spread threatening the financial and industrial centers of that nation.At their heart, stock prices rise and fall with the profits that companies make. And Wall Streets expectations for profit growth are sliding away. Apple and Microsoft, two of the worlds biggest companies, have already said their sales this quarter will feel the economic effects of the virus.Goldman Sachs on Thursday said earnings for companies in the SP 500 index might not grow at all this year, after predicting earlier that they would grow 5.5. Strategist David Kostin also cut his growth forecast for earnings next year.Besides a sharply weaker Chinese economy in the first quarter of this year, he sees lower demand for U.S. exporters, disruptions to supply chains and general uncertainty eating away at earnings growth.Such cuts are even more impactful now because stocks are already trading at high levels relative to their earnings, raising the risk. Before the virus worries exploded, investors had been pushing stocks higher on expectations that strong profit growth was set to resume for companies after declining for most of 2019.The SP 500 recently traded at its most expensive level, relative to its expected earnings per share, since the dotcom bubble was deflating in 2002, according to FactSet. If profit growth doesnt ramp up this year, that makes a highly priced stock market even more vulnerable.Goldman Sachs Kostin predicted the SP 500 could fall to 2,900 in the near term, which would be a nearly 7 drop from Wednesdays close, before rebounding to 3,400 by the end of the year.Traders are growing increasingly certain that the Federal Reserve will be forced to cut interest rates to protect the economy, and soon. They are pricing in a 96 probability of a cut at the Feds next meeting in March. Just a day before, they were calling for only a 33 chance, according to CME Group.The markets sharp drop this week partly reflects increasing fears among many economists that the U.S. and global economies could take a bigger hit from the coronavirus than they previously thought.Earlier assumptions that the impact would largely be contained in China and would temporarily disrupt manufacturing supply chains have been overtaken by concerns that as the virus spreads, more people in numerous countries will stay home, either voluntarily or under quarantine. Vacations could be canceled, restaurant meals skipped, and fewer shopping trips taken.A global recession is likely if COVID19 becomes a pandemic, and the odds of that are uncomfortably high and rising with infections surging in Italy and Korea, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moodys Analytics.The market rout will also likely weaken Americans confidence in the economy, analysts say, even among those who dont own shares. Such volatility can worry people about their own companies and job security. In addition, Americans that do own stocks feel less wealthy. Both of those trends can combine to discourage consumer spending and slow growth.MARKET ROUNDUPThe SP 500 fell 137.63 points, or 4.4, to 2,978.76. The Dow fell 1,190.95 points, or 4.4, to 25,766.64.

       " 'This should have been a good year for global tourism, with trade tensions gradually easing, certain economies growing and banner events like the Summer Olympics taking place in Tokyo. But the viral outbreak in China has thrown the travel industry into chaos, threatening billions in losses and keeping millions of wouldbe travelers at home.Gabrielle Autry, an American who lives in China, had expected to travel to Hong Kong this week to get engaged to her Chinese boyfriend. But those plans are on hold, and the couple is quarantined in their apartment in Hangzhou, an eighthour drive from the epicenter of the outbreak in Wuhan. As of Friday, China reported more than 31,000 cases and 636 deaths.We are thankful for our health and that we are together here, Autry said. She doesnt know when they will be able to reschedule their trip.Thirty airlines have suspended service to China and 25,000 flights were canceled this week alone, according to OAG, a travel data company. Hotel rooms in China are largely empty Chinese hotel occupancy plummeted 75 in the last two weeks of January, according to STR, a hotel research firm. More than 7,000 passengers arequarantined on two cruise shipsin Japan and Hong Kong.Before the outbreak, the United Nations World Tourism Organization was forecasting growth of 34 in global tourism this year, an increase over the 1.5 billion tourist arrivals in 2019. Upsides, like economic improvement in the Middle East and Latin America, outweighed some potential downsides, like the uncertainty of Brexit or any lingering U.S.China trade disputes.Central to those numbers was the promise of an evergrowing number of travelers from China, where rapidly growing incomes have led to a global tourism boom. In 2018, Chinese tourists made nearly 150 million trips abroad and spent 277 billion, according to IHS Markit. Thats up from just 15.4 billion in 2002.The loss of those tourists is being felt most acutely in Asia, which usually attracts 75 of Lunar New Year travelers, says ForwardKeys, a travel consulting company. The new year, which began Jan. 25, is one of Chinas major travel periods.Disney said Wednesday it could lose 175 million if its parks in Hong Kong and Shanghai remain closed for two months.Thailand expects to lose 9.7 billion in tourist income from Chinese travelers through June, Tourism and Sports Minister Pipat Ratchakitprakan told The Associated Press.The day that we heard the news (about the virus), the tourists were gone, said Arisara Chamsue, who runs a shop near the Grand Palace in Bangkok. The number has dropped. And I can only make a tenth or two tenths of what I normally make.Tourists from elsewhere are also canceling travel to Asia. Brian Guyer of Bozeman, Montana, planned to go to Japan next week for a dream ski vacation after finding a good deal on Alaska Airlines. But he and his partner decided to cancel because the trip required a 14hour layover in Beijing. They werent sure theyd be allowed to enter Japan or the U.S. after passing through China.Others are taking a waitandsee approach, including concert pianist Julio Elizalde and violinist Ray Chen. The two have a sixcity concert tour of China scheduled in May. Theyre watching closely as long as things improve over the next month or two, Elizalde says they plan to honor that commitment.The cancellations, however, are adding up for airlines. Tourism Economics, a data and consulting firm, estimates that U.S. airlines will lose 1.6 billion this year because of lost business to and from China. The firm doesnt have estimates for Chinese airlines.Cruise lines are also feeling the pinch. Carnival and Royal Caribbean have canceled around 20 China cruises between them, and many cruise lines arent letting passengers board if they have been in China or Hong Kong in the 14 days before the ship sails. That affects thousands of passengers Royal Caribbeans Shanghaibased Spectrum of the Seas ship has a doubleoccupancy capacity of 4,246 people.Miamibased Royal Caribbean estimates that the cancellations so far will shave about 1 off 2020 earnings, and that will double if travel restrictions in China are still in place at the end of February.Destinations further from the outbreak are also feeling the loss of Chinese tourists. Australia, already battered by wildfires, just imposed a travel ban on visitors from mainland China. China was the largest source for international visitors to Australia last year, with 1.4 million tourists who spent 13.4 billion, according to IHS Markit.Italy could lose 5 billion in tourism revenue this year, said Demoskopika, a polling agency. In the U.S., Tourism Economics predicts a 28 drop in Chinese visitors, to around 2 million. That represents about 6 billion less spent on travel and airfare.Some worried travelers are even canceling trips to places that arent yet impacted. Stanley Kolodziejczak, tax director at White and Case law firm in New York, planned to visit South Africa and Brazil this year, but those trips are on hold. Hes concerned those countries wouldnt have the systems in place to detect and manage the virus.But Christina Pedroni, senior vice president of Liberty Travel, a New Jerseybased travel agency, said she hasnt seen many cancellations for destinations outside of Asia. Some customers heading to Asia switched to another destination instead of cancelling entirely, she said.This could change if the situation grows more severe. But for now, most travelers are leaving impending travel plans as they are, Pedroni said.Tourism will recover, as it has from previous health scares. But analysts are divided about the amount of time that recovery will take. Tourism Economics, citing the SARS outbreak in 2003, expects it will be four years before Chinese tourism to the U.S. gets back to previously expected levels. The World Travel and Tourism Council, a tourism advocacy group, says it usually takes 19 months for visitor numbers to recover after a viral outbreak.David Tarsh, a spokesman for ForwardKeys, said there are some key differences with the SARS epidemic, which killed 774 people in 2003. In that case, he said, media reported that the virus was impacting all of southeast Asia, even though it was confined to China, Vietnam, Hong Kong and Singapore. That hurt tourism even in places that were far from the outbreak, like India.This time, he said, travelers are more likely to understand that the virus is centered in Wuhan, China, which could help the recovery progress more quickly.SARS also hit when travelers were still fearful after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in New York, he said. Tarsh also said China has been more open about its response this time around.China has taken very dramatic action, he said.',\n",
       " 'The United States and China reached a trade deal Wednesday that eases tensions between the worlds two biggest economies, offers massive export opportunities for U.S. farms and factories, and promises to do more to protect American trade secrets.Still, the Phase 1 agreement leaves unresolved Washingtons fundamental differences with Beijing, which is relying on massive government intervention in the economy to turn China into a technological power.President Donald Trump is wanting to show progress on an issue that he has made a hallmark of his presidency and hopes to use in his reelection campaign this year. Wednesdays signing ceremony at the White House gave him the chance to do that just hours before the House voted to send articles of impeachment to the Senate for a trial.Trump promoted the trade signing as a way of delivering economic justice for American workers he claims have been betrayed by past administrations and their trade policies.We mark more than just an agreement. We mark a sea change in international trade, Trump declared during a rambling ceremony in which he made references to former FBI Director James Comey, the impeachment proceedings and a possible visit to Mount Rushmore on July Fourth for a fireworks display.The Chinese delegation also praised the pact. Chinese leader Xi Jinping said in a letter to Trump that the firstphase deal was good for China, for the U.S. and for the whole world. He said it also showed the two countries had the ability to act on the basis of equality and mutual respect. The letter was read by Beijings chief negotiator, Vice Premier Liu He.Some of the presidents Democratic critics were unimpressed.True to form, Trump is getting precious little in return for the significant pain and uncertainty he has imposed on our economy, farmers, and workers, said former Vice President Joe Biden, one of the Democrats hoping to replace Trump.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, DCalif., said in a statement that with the economy losing thousands of manufacturing jobs and Farm Country reeling from the damage caused by President Trump, Americans are left with nothing more than a showy television ceremony to try to hide the complete absence of concrete progress, transparency or accountability in this ‘phase one agreement.The administration acknowledges the agreement leaves unresolved some U.S. complaints  most notably, the way the Chinese government subsidizes its companies. That was the concern voiced when Trump sparked a trade war by imposing tariffs on Chinese imports in July 2018.The Phase 1 deal contains meaningful commitments but by no means lives up to the initial objectives of the administration, said Wendy Cutler, a former U.S. trade negotiator who is now vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute. Further Chinese concessions would force Bejing to make major changes in its statedominated economic model, which means the prospects for a timely conclusion are remote, she said.The agreement leaves in place tariffs on about 360 billion in Chinese imports, leverage the administration hopes will generate future concessions.U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said work on followup negotiations will hinge on how China fulfills the commitments it made in the initial phase.We have to make sure this is implemented properly, Lighthizer said. This is the first agreement like this of its kind and we have to make sure that it works.The agreement is intended to ease some U.S. economic sanctions on China while Beijing is to step up purchases of American farm products and other goods. Trump cited beef, pork, poultry, seafood, rice and dairy products as examples.U.S. trade officials said the agreement would end a longstanding practice of China pressuring foreign companies to transfer technology to Chinese companies as a condition for obtaining market access. Lighthizer said China has also agreed to combat patent theft and counterfeit products, which would include forfeiting machinery used for making counterfeit products.The 86page agreement makes it easier to bring criminal cases in China against those accused of stealing trade secrets. It includes provisions designed to stop Chinese government officials from using administrative and regulatory procedures to ferret out foreign companies trade secrets and allowing that information to get into the hands of Chinese competitors.The deal requires China to come up with procedures to permit effective and expeditious action to take down websites that sell pirated goods. China also must make it possible for ecommerce sites to lose their licenses for repeated failures to curb the sale of counterfeit or pirated goods.China is required to increase its purchases of U.S. manufactured, energy and farm products and services by a combined 200 billion this year and next. The arrangement means that China is supposed to buy 40 billion in U.S. farm exports. That would be a windfall for Trump supporters in rural America but an ambitious goal considering that China has never bought more than 26 billion in U.S. agricultural products in a year.Its a strong first step, said Jeremie Waterman, the U.S. Chamber of Commerces vice president for Greater China. It begins the process of addressing some of the structural concerns, but theres a lot of work left to do. The meat, the core of (U.S. complaints about Chinas aggressive tech policies) has not yet been addressed. Obviously, thats going to have to wait until Phase 2.Most analysts say any meaningful resolution of the main U.S. allegation  that Beijing uses predatory tactics in its drive to supplant Americas technological supremacy  could require years of contentious talks. Skeptics say a satisfactory resolution may be next to impossible given Chinas ambitions to become the global leader in such advanced technologies as driverless cars and artificial intelligence.The U.S. has dropped plans to impose tariffs on an additional 160 billion in Chinese imports, and it cut in half, to 7.5, existing tariffs on 110 billion of good from China.Derek Scissors, China specialist at the American Enterprise Institute, said the trade war has already delivered a benefit for Trump, even if it hasnt forced Beijing to make major changes to its economic policy Trumps tariffs have reduced Chinese exports to the United States and narrowed Americas trade deficit with China.So far this year, the U.S. deficit with China in the trade of goods has declined by 16, or 62 billion, to 321 billion compared with a year earlier. The deficit will narrow further if Beijing lives up to its pledges to buy dramatically more American imports.',\n",
       " 'In a daring escape that confounded authorities, Nissans former Chairman Carlos Ghosn skipped bail while awaiting trial in Japan on allegations of financial misconduct and reappeared in Lebanon, where he said Tuesday that he had fled to avoid political persecution.Ghosn, who is of Lebanese origin and holds French, Lebanese and Brazilian passports, disclosed his location in a statement through his representatives but did not say how he managed to get out of Japan, where he had been under surveillance. He promised to talk to reporters next week.I am now in Lebanon and will no longer be held hostage by a rigged Japanese justice system where guilt is presumed, discrimination is rampant, and basic human rights are denied, in flagrant disregard of Japans legal obligations under international law and treaties it is bound to uphold, the statement said.Speaking anonymously, prosecutors in Japan told Japanese media they did not know how Ghosn got out. His lawyer also denied all knowledge of the escape, saying he was stunned. Japan does not have an extradition treaty with Lebanon, which said Ghosn had entered the country legally and there was no reason to take any action against him.He is home, Ghosns friend, television host Ricardo Karam said in a message. Its a big adventure.Karam said Ghosn arrived in Lebanon on Monday morning, but declined to elaborate. The Lebanonbased newspaper AlJoumhouriya said Ghosn arrived in Beirut from Turkey aboard a private jet.Ghosn was arrested in November 2018 and was expected to face trial in April 2020. He posted 1.5 billion yen (14 million) bail on two separate instances after he was arrested a second time on additional charges, and released again.Prosecutors fought his release, but a court granted him bail on condition that he be monitored and not meet with his wife, Carole, who is also of Lebanese origin. Recently, the court allowed them to speak by video.Ghosn, who was charged with underreporting his future compensation and breach of trust, has repeatedly asserted his innocence, saying authorities trumped up charges to prevent a possible fuller merger between Nissan Motor Co. and alliance partner Renault SA.Maybe he thought he wont get a fair trial, said his lawyer, Junichiro Hironaka, stressing that he continues to believe Ghosn is innocent. I cant blame him for thinking that way.The charges Ghosn faces carry a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison.How Ghosn managed to flee was, publicly at least, a mystery. Hironaka said the lawyers were holding Ghosns three passports, yet Lebanons minister for presidential affairs, Selim Jreissati, told the AnNahar newspaper that Ghosn entered legally at the airport with a French passport and Lebanese ID.France reacted with surprise and some confusion.The French foreign ministry said in a statement that French authorities have heard from the press about the arrival of Carlos Ghosn to Lebanon. They have not been informed of his departure from Japan and have no knowledge of the circumstances of his departure, the statement said.Agnes PannierRunacher, a junior finance minister, told broadcaster BFMTV that I was surprised as you when I learned about this escape.Ghosns lawyer, Hironaka, said he last spoke with his client on Christmas Day and was never consulted about leaving for Lebanon. However, he said the circumstances of Ghosns arrest, the seizure of evidence and the strict bail conditions were unfair.Jreissati told AnNaharhe he had asked Japan to hand Ghosn over to be tried in Lebanon according to international anticorruption laws. However, since there was no official word from Tokyo and it was not yet clear how Ghosn came to Lebanon, Beirut wouldnt take a formal position. Jreissati did not immediately respond to calls from The Associated Press.People in Lebanon take special pride in the auto industry icon, who is credited with leading a spectacular turnaround at Nissan beginning in the late 1990s, and rescued the automaker from nearbankruptcy.Ghosn speaks fluent Arabic and visited the country regularly. Born in Brazil, where his Lebanese grandfather had sought his fortune, Ghosn grew up in Beirut, where he spent part of his childhood at a Jesuit school.Before his fall from grace, Ghosn was also a celebrity in Japan, where he was revered for his managerial acumen.Nissan did not have immediate comment Tuesday. The Japanese automaker of the March subcompact, Leaf electric car and Infiniti luxury models has also been charged as a company in relation to Ghosns alleged financial crimes.Japanese securities regulators recently recommended Nissan be fined 2.4 billion yen (22 million) over disclosure documents from 2014 to 2017. Nissan has said it accepted the penalty and corrected its securities documents in May.The companys sales and profits have tumbled and its brand image is tarnished. It has acknowledged lapses in its governance and has promised to improve its transparency.Another former Nissan executive, Greg Kelly, an American, was arrested at the same time as Ghosn and is awaiting trial. He has said he is innocent.Hiroto Saikawa, who replaced Ghosn as head of Nissan, announced his resignation in September after financial misconduct allegations surfaced against him related to his income. He has not been charged with any crime.The conviction rate in Japan exceeds 99 and winning an acquittal through a lengthy appeals process could take years. Rights activists in Japan and abroad say Japans judicial system does not presume innocence enough and relies on long detentions that lead to false confessions.In addition to underreporting his future compensation, Ghosn is accused of diverting Nissan money and having it shoulder his personal investment losses. Other allegations against him involve payments to a Saudi dealership, as well as funds paid to an Oman business that were purportedly diverted to entities run by Ghosn.Ghosn has said that the compensation was never decided, that Nissan never suffered losses from the investments and that all the payments were for legitimate business services.',\n",
       " 'Chinas Huawei Technologies said Tuesday that its sales rose a lowerthanprojected 18 in 2019 and predicted tough times ahead as the U.S. moves to restrict its business.The flash sales estimate came in an annual New Years message to employees. Chairman Eric Xu warned that mediocre managers would face demotion as the telecom giant and leader in 5G mobile technology focuses on survival.Its going to be a difficult year for us, he wrote, calling on the companys more than 190,000 employees to work hard and go the extra mile to bring their capabilities to a new level.No one is predicting Huaweis demise. The unlisted company, a major maker of both mobile transmission equipment and handsets, estimated that 2019 sales would rise to more than 850 billion yuan (120 billion).These figures are lower than our initial projections, yet business remains solid and we stand strong in the face of adversity, Xu said in the letter, which was released to The Associated Press and other media.Huawei, based in the tech hub of Shenzhen in southern China, typically releases its official and audited annual financial results in March.Zou Zhidan, an analyst at the consulting firm Zero Power in Shenzhen, said that given Huaweis size and the breadth of its business, it wont face a survival crisis. Rather, it will face obstacles to progress and pressure on its rapid profit growth, he said in an email response to questions.Zou noted that Huawei enjoys a relatively good reputation outside of the U.S. and will benefit from its leading position in the still nascent 5G market.The difficulties for Huawei in 2020 wont be small, but the company has its own strengths, Zou wrote.The U.S. government says Huawei technology poses a security risk and has urged other countries not to buy its 5G mobile network equipment. It has also put Huawei on its entity list, blocking U.S. technology sales to the company. Huawei denies the allegation.Calling difficulty the prelude to greater success, Xu said Americas strategic and longterm campaign against Huawei is an opportunity to build up some muscle and build capabilities to navigate future challenges.Despite concerted efforts by the U.S. government to keep us down, weve made it out the other side and continue to create value for our customers, he wrote.The fivepage letter exhorts employees to hone their skills and rid themselves of complacency. Saying that survival is the companys top priority, Xu warns that mediocre managers who have lost their enterprising spirit will be removed faster than before.',\n",
       " 'The Trump administration and China are close to finalizing a modest trade agreement that would suspend tariffs that are set to kick in Sunday, deescalating their 17month trade war.A deal is close, said Myron Brilliant, the U.S. Chamber of Commerces head of international affairs, who has been briefed by both sides.Brilliant said the administration has agreed to suspend Trumps plans to impose tariffs on 160 billion in Chinese imports Sunday and to reduce existing tariffs, though it wasnt clear by how much.In return, Beijing would buy more U.S. farm products, increase Americans companies access to the Chinese market and tighten protection for intellectual property rights.The deal awaits final approval from President Donald Trump.Trump took to Twitter early Thursday to declare Getting VERY close to a BIG DEAL with China. They want it, and so do we!The presidents comments triggered a daylong rally on Wall Street. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 220 points, or 0.8.Thursday evening, a senior administration official said a policy announcement regarding China would take place on Friday. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal planning.Earlier Thursday, a spokesman for Chinas Ministry of Commerce, Gao Feng, had told reporters that the economic and trade teams of both sides have maintained close communication. He offered no additional details.Beijing had threatened to retaliate if Trump proceeded with plans to raise tariffs on 160 billion of Chinese imports Sunday.The two sides are negotiating a socalled Phase 1 agreement as part of the effort to resolve their sprawling trade dispute. Still, the truce leaves unsettled the toughest and most complex issues that have divided the two sides.Three Democratic senators  Minority Leader Charles Schumer of New York, Ron Wyden of Oregon and Sherrod Brown of Ohio  sent a letter to the White House on Thursday, urging Trump to stand firm in the negotiations with China. They called on the president to hold out for commitments from the Chinese government to enact substantive, enforceable and permanent structural reform.The administration accuses Beijing of cheating in its drive to achieve global supremacy in such advanced technologies as driverless cars and artificial intelligence. The administration alleges  and independent analysts generally agree  that China steals technology, forces foreign companies to hand over trade secrets, unfairly subsidizes its own firms and throws up bureaucratic hurdles for foreign rivals.Beijing rejects the accusations and contends that Washington is simply trying to suppress a rising competitor in international trade.Since July 2018, the Trump administration has imposed import taxes on 360 billion in Chinese products. Beijing has retaliated by taxing 120 billion in U.S. exports, including soybeans and other farm products that are vital to many of Trumps supporters in rural America.On Sunday, the administration was set to start taxing an additional 160 billion in Chinese imports, a move that would extend the sanctions to just about everything China ships to the United States.Repeated rounds of negotiations had failed to achieve even a preliminary agreement. The prolonged uncertainty over Trumps trade policies has curtailed U.S. business investment and likely held back economic growth. Many corporations have slowed or suspended investment plans until they know when, how or even whether the trade standoff will end.A farreaching agreement on Chinas technology policies will likely prove difficult. It would require Beijing to scale back its drive to become a global powerhouse in industrial high technology, something it sees as a path to prosperity and international influence.Efforts to acquire foreign technology are a theme that runs through Chinese law and government. Security researchers have asserted that Beijing operates a network of research institutes and business parks to turn stolen foreign technology into commercial products.The Trump administration has been seeking a way to enforce any significant trade agreement with China, reflecting its contention that Beijing has violated past promises. One way to do is to retain some tariffs as leverage.Theyre two such different economies that dont trust each other, said Jessica Wasserman, a trade lawyer at Greenspoon Marder LLP.',\n",

       " 'For decades, Huaweis founder stayed out of sight as it grew to become the biggest maker of network gear for phone carriers and passed Apple as the No. 2 smartphone brand.Now, Ren Zhengfei is shedding that anonymity as Chinas first global tech brand mobilizes to fight back against U.S. sanctions and warnings Huawei Technologies Ltd. is a security risk.The entrepreneur at the center of the Trump administrations battle with Beijing over technology is a survivor of competition that drove Western rivals out of the market, brushes with financial disaster and job stress so severe he contemplated suicide.The 75yearold former army engineer who worked his way out of childhood poverty sees American pressure as just the latest of the tests that have hardened him and his company.For three decades, Huawei has been suffering and no joy, Ren said in an interview. The pain of each episode is different.This episode has a personal dimension Rens daughter, Huaweis chief financial officer, is under arrest in Canada on U.S. charges she helped to violate sanctions against Iran.The escalating clash with Washington has transformed Ren from an admired but rarely seen businessman worth an estimated 3 billion into one of Chinas most prominent figures.He belongs to the generation of entrepreneurs who founded communistera Chinas first private companies in the 1980s. They navigated a shifting, statedominated landscape, overcoming shortages of money and technology to create industries that are expanding abroad.Ren launched Huawei in 1987 after his military post was eliminated.Huawei is a star in industries the ruling Communist Party is promoting but a target for complaints those plans are based on stealing or pressuring foreign companies to hand over business secrets.Despite his success, Ren talks like a struggling rookie, worrying aloud that employees might get too comfortable.Ren writes letters urging employees to prepare for the worst, said Nicole Peng of Canalys, an industry research firm.As for whether his character can help the company to survive, said Peng, Im sure it will. It will survive. Like he said, they are prepared for it. They know there is always difficulty.Born in 1944, Ren was raised by a schoolteacher who he said fed seven children on a monthly wage of 40 yuan (6).When Ren was a teenager, the ruling party embarked on the Great Leap Forward, a disastrous campaign to become an industrial power overnight. At least 30 million people died in the 195961 famine that followed.Rens mother declared no one would die and divided each meal into nine portions, one for each family member, said Tian Tao, coauthor of The Huawei Story.His mothers ‘meal system had a big impact on him, said Tian.Following that ethos, Huawei says it is owned by the Chinese citizens who make up half its workforce of 180,000. Rens ownership has declined to 1.14 as more shares are distributed to employees.Ren joined the army in the 1960s and was sent to the northeast to build a textile factory. He said he slept outdoors in weather as cold as 28 C (18 F) and ate noodles and pickled radish.Ren says he has tried to ensure Huaweis longterm survival through a system of shared decisionmaking. Still, he is known as a forceful, even autocratic, decisionmaker.That was highlighted by a battle in 2000 over whether to develop the personal handyphone system, which caught on as a lowcost alternative to mobile service. Ren rejected PHS as a distraction from work on nextgeneration mobile technology that promised to be cheaper and more reliable.Ren said he resisted appeals to back PHS as bills for 3G development rose to 6 billion yuan (750 million).Todays crisis is onetenth or 1 of the pressure at that time, Ren said.Tian, his biographer, said Huawei employees told him Ren, unable to sleep, would call and worry aloud about how to pay a 300 million yuan (50 million) monthly wage bill.When Ren Zhengfei talked with employees six or seven years ago, he revealed a secret He had suicidal thoughts several times, said Tian, a Huawei adviser and codirector of the Ruihua Innovation Research Institute at Zhejiang University.Following his daughters December 2018 arrest in Vancouver, Huawei launched a charm offensive aimed at defusing Western suspicions the company facilitates Chinese spying.Ren gives interviews lasting up to two hours to reporters and TV crews who trek to Shenzhen, a former fishing village near Hong Kong that is now a technology center of 15 million people.Ren, a ruling party member, tried to defuse security concerns by promising in January he would defy any official demands to reveal foreign customers secrets.Huawei, along with Nokia Corp. and LM Ericsson, leads in fifthgeneration telecom technology. It is meant to upgrade and expand networks to support selfdriving cars and other futuristic applications. But that increased reach makes 5G politically sensitive.The companys U.S. market vanished in 2012 after a congressional panel declared Huawei a security risk.Despite that, sales tripled as Huawei made inroads into Europe, Asia and Africa. Sales last year rose almost 20 percent to 105 billion.U.S. export controls, if enforced, will disrupt Huaweis access to processor chips and other technology. Its smartphones would lose Google maps and other services, making it hard to compete.To limit that impact, Ren has emphasized making Huawei a selfreliant technology creator. This years research spending is due to rise 20 to 17 billion.The company has released a smartphone operating system it says can replace Googles Android if necessary. It makes some of its own processor chips but needs U.S. suppliers for highend products.They do things from scratch, said Peng. I think this is the influence of the founder.',\n",
       " 'Saudi Arabia formally started its longanticipated initial public offering of its staterun oil giant Saudi Aramco on Sunday, which will see a sliver of the firm offered on a local stock exchange in hopes of raising billions of dollars for the kingdom.An announcement from the kingdoms Capital Market Authority announcing its approval for the share sale served as a starting gun for an IPO promised by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman since 2016.The firms shares will be traded on Riyadhs Tadawul stock exchange, said Amin H. Nasser, the president and CEO of Aramco, in an online video. Plans call for the firm to put other shares on a foreign exchange in the future.This is transformational and historic moment for Saudi Aramco, Nasser said. He also stressed Aramcos disciplined financial approach and prudent and flexible balance sheet.Prince Mohammed hopes for a veryoptimistic 2 trillion valuation for Aramco, which produces 10 million barrels of crude oil a day and provides some 10 of global demand. That would raise the 100 billion he needs for his ambitious redevelopment plans for a Saudi Arabia hoping for new jobs, as unemployment stands at over 10.However, economic worries, the trade war between China and the U.S. and increased crude oil production by the U.S. has depressed energy prices. A Sept. 14 attack on the heart of Aramco already spooked some investors, with one ratings company already downgrading the oil giant.The announcement by the Capital Market Authority offered no timeline for the IPO, nor did documents later released by Aramco.The Capital Market Authority board has issued its resolution approving the Saudi Arabian Oil Co. application for the registration and offering of part of its shares, the authority said in its statement. The companys prospectus will be published prior to the start of the subscription period.The Saudiowned satellite channel AlArabiya reported last week, citing anonymous sources, that pricing for the stock will begin Nov. 17. A final price for the stock will be set Dec. 4, with shares then beginning to be traded on the Tadawul on Dec. 11, the channel reported. The channel is believed to have close links to the kingdoms Al Saud royal family.Aramco in its IPO documentation said the percentage of the company offered and the share price will be determined at the end of the bookbuilding period. It said Aramco had a net income of 111.1 billion in 2018 and proven liquid reserves of 226.8 billion barrels. It said its net income as of the end of the third quarter this year was 68 billion.Shares will be offered to institutional investors, as well as individual Saudi and foreign investors.The kingdom has in the past used the company as a piggy bank for development companies, back when it was still an American company. Since buying a 100 interest in the firm by 1980, the royal family as its sole shareholder largely hasnt interfered in the companys longterm business decisions as its revenue provides around 60 of all government revenue.But recently, there have been decisions seemingly forced onto Aramco, including the nearly 70 billion purchase in March of the petrochemical firm Saudi Basic Industries Corp. just before SABIC announced a plunge in its quarterly profits.In Aramcos firstever halfyear results, it reported income of 46.8 billion. Yet analysts say a 2 trillion valuation  Apple and Microsoft separately for instance are 1 trillion  may be a stretch. By announcing the start of the IPO on Sunday, Prince Mohammed may have been convinced to take a lower valuation in order to get the IPO moving. The kingdom likely is pinning its hopes on tremendous local interest to push up the companys valuation before potentially taking some of the stock abroad.Analysts believe Aramco will list as much as 3 of the firm on the Tadawul, with another 2 put abroad.Saudi Aramco has sought to assure investors, given the questions over its valuation and the potential hazards of future attacks or geopolitical risk. A presentation posted to Aramcos website last month announced the intent to offer a 75 billion dividend for investors in 2020. Thats the payment per share that a corporation distributes to its stockholders as their return on the money they have invested in its stock.It also pledged that some 2020 through 2024, any year with a dividend under 75 billion would see nongovernment shareholders prioritized to get paid.But beyond the stocks, worries persist that Saudi Arabia could be hit by another attack like the one Sept. 14, which the U.S. blames on Iran. Iran denies it launched the cruise missiles and drones used in the attack. Yemens Houthi rebels claimed responsibility, but analysts say the weapons used wouldnt have the range to reach their targets from Houthicontrolled areas of Yemen.']"
