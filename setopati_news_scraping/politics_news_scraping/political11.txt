CPNUML Chairman KP Sharma Oli and leader Madhav Kumar Nepal, the warring leaders of ruling party that is on the verge of split, have met for the second consecutive day at Kathmandu Marriott Hotel Thursday.The details of the oneonone meeting of the two leaders have yet to arrive but Nepal is understood to have reiterated his demand for taking back the unilateral decisions Oli took on March 12 and moving forward from the state the party was on the day of unification with CPN Maoist Center during the meeting.Dispute in UML has reached boiling point after the Supreme Court SC invalidated unification of UML with CPN Maoist Center on March 7 reinstating the two parties to the sate they were on the day of unification.The KhanalNepal faction on Wednesday moved the SC against Oli and the Apex Court has registered the petition on Thursday listing it for hearing on Sunday.We demand revocation of the socalled decision of March 12, intraparty instruction given on the basis of that decision, the action taken and to be taken against us, amendment of party statute, division of responsibilities, order related to removing obstacles as they are illegal, illintentioned, and against the Constitution of Nepal and the act related to political parties right from the beginning, the petition states. We demand a mandamus ordering that the central committee elected by the ninth general convention in accordance to the UML statute be allowed to function as previously.The petition also demands certiorari order to block the action to be taken against 27 leaders including the petitioners. It also points that they strongly suspect that Oli can expel them from the party and has sought to stop that.Oli on Tuesday sent letters to 27 leaders giving them three days to explain why they should not be expelled from the federal parliament. They have also been warned that they can be punished any time for acting against the party and what the party claims is a popular government.The leaders who have been asked to furnish explanation include Madhav Kumar Nepal, Jhala Nath Khanal, Bhim Rawal, Ghanashyam Bhusal, Surendra Pandey, Met Mani Chaudhari, Pabitra Niroula, Jhapat Rawal, Yagya Raj Sunuwar, Jeevan Ram Shrestha, Bhawani Khapung, Birodh Khatiwada, Som Prasad Pandey, Narayan Khatiwada, Ganesh Pahari, Jaya Kumar Rai, Dipak Prakash Bhatta, Yogesh Bhattarai, Hira Chandra KC, Pushpa Kumari Karna Kayastha, Kalyani Khadka, Laxmi Kumari Chaudhari, Krishna Lal Maharjan, Sarala Kumari Yadav, Nira Devi Jairu, Ram Kuamri Jhakri and Mukunda Neupane.Oli had earlier suspended a few leaders including Nepal from the party for six months.
