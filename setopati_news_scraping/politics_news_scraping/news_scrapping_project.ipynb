       "['The U.S. will begin sharing its entire stock of AstraZeneca COVID19 vaccines with the world once it clears federal safety reviews, the White House said Monday, with as many as 60 million doses expected to be available for export in the coming months.The move greatly expands on the Biden administrations action last month to share about 4 million doses of the vaccine with Mexico and Canada. The AstraZeneca vaccine is widely in use around the world but has not yet been authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.The White House is increasingly feeling assured about the supply of the three vaccines being administered in the U.S., particularly following the restart of the singledose Johnson  Johnson shot over the weekend. The U.S. has also been under mounting pressure in recent weeks to share more of its vaccine supply with the world, as countries like India experience devastating surges of the virus and others struggle to access doses needed to protect their most vulnerable populations.Given the strong portfolio of vaccines that the U.S. already has and that have been authorized by the FDA, and given that the AstraZeneca vaccine is not authorized for use in the U.S., we do not need to use the AstraZeneca vaccine here during the next several months, said White House COVID19 coordinator Jeff Zients. Therefore the U.S. is looking at options to share the AstraZeneca doses with other countries as they become available.More than 3 million people worldwide have died of COVID19, including more than 572,000 in the U.S. The U.S. has vaccinated more than 53 of its adult population with at least one dose of its three authorized vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and JJ, and it expects to have enough supply for its entire population by early summer.About 10 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine have been produced but have yet to pass review by the FDA to meet its expectations for product quality, Zients said, noting the U.S. regulator is recognized as the gold standard for safety around the world. That process could be completed in the next several weeks. About 50 million more doses are in various stages of production and could be available to ship in May and June pending FDA signoff.The U.S. has yet to finalize where the AstraZeneca doses will go, Zients said. Neighbors Mexico and Canada have asked the Biden administration to share more doses, while dozens of other countries are looking to access supplies of the vaccine.Were in the planning process at this point in time, said White House press secretary Jen Psaki, when asked where the doses would go.The AstraZeneca doses will be donated by the U.S. government, which has contracted with the company for a total of 300 million doses  though the company has faced production issues.The administrations move to share vaccines drew praise from nongovernmental aid groups, who encouraged the White House to develop plans to share even more doses.The Biden administrations decision to begin sharing AstraZeneca vaccines is welcome news and an important first step towards the US sharing more of its massive vaccine stockpile, said Tom Hart, acting CEO at The ONE Campaign. The Biden administration should build on this welcome first step and start sharing more vaccines as soon as possible.In part because the AstraZeneca vaccine is not expected to play a significant factor in the U.S. virus response, the White House was also moving to share raw materials for the production of the AstraZeneca vaccine with India, which has emerged as a global hotspot for the virus, by diverting some of its orders to the vaccine manufacturer Serum Institute of India.Zients told the AP that the Biden administration was working to satisfy other key requests from the Indian government, namely for personal protective equipment, tests, therapeutics and supplies of oxygen and respiratory assistance devices.The administrations identified U.S. commercial suppliers of therapeutics that are immediately available to help relieve the suffering of the COVID19 patients in India, said Zients. Weve identified rapid diagnostic tests and supplies and PPE, and additional ventilators that are available to transferred to India.Epidemiologists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were also expected to soon travel to India to assist the country with its virus response.The additional quality review before the U.S. shares the AstraZeneca doses were in order because of issues at the facility that produced them, White House officials said.AstraZenecas doses in the U.S. were produced at an Emergent BioSolutions plant in Baltimore that has come under increased regulatory and public scrutiny after botching batches of the JJ vaccine. The U.S. pressed JJ to take over the plant and, as part of the effort to ensure the quality of newly produced vaccines, directed the facility to stop making the AstraZeneca shot. AstraZeneca is still looking to identify a new U.S. production facility for its future doses.The U.S. government ordered enough for 150 million Americans before issues with the vaccines clinical trial held up clearance. The companys 30,000person U.S. trial didnt complete enrollment until January, and it still has not filed for an emergencyuse authorization with the FDA.',\n",
       " 'The Supreme Court SC has refused to issue interim order demanded by the KhanalNepal faction of ruling CPNUML to stop Chairman KP Sharma Oli from taking action against leaders of the faction.A single bench of Justice Prakash Dhungana hearing the petition on Monday has said there is no need to issue the interim order demanded by petitioners as the leaders have just been asked to submit explanation and not punished.The demanded interim order does not need to be issued merely on the basis of seeking explanation for internal party works in the preliminary state now, the bench has stated. The SC has also asked the defendants to reply within 15 days the reason for seeking explanation from the leaders and why the demanded interim order need not be issued.UML leaders Madhav Kumar Nepal, Bhim Rawal and Ghanashyam Bhusal reached the Apex Court on April 21 claiming that Olis decision to dissolve the central committee to form organizing committee for general convention and take action against them is against the party statute and laws of the land.The SC registered the petition the next day after taking a day to study whether it deserves to be registered or not.We demand revocation of the socalled decision of March 12, intraparty instruction given on the basis of that decision, the action taken and to be taken against us, amendment of party statute, division of responsibilities, order related to removing obstacles as they are illegal, illintentioned, and against the Constitution of Nepal and the act related to political parties right from the beginning, the petition stated. We demand a mandamus ordering that the central committee elected by the ninth general convention in accordance to the UML statute be allowed to function as previously.The petition also demanded certiorari order to block the action to be taken against 27 leaders including the petitioners. It also pointed that they strongly suspect that Oli can expel them from the party and has sought to stop that.Oli on April 20 sent letters to 27 leaders giving them three days to explain why they should not be expelled from the federal parliament. They have also been warned that they can be punished any time for acting against the party and what the party claims is a popular government.The leaders who were asked to furnish explanation include Madhav Kumar Nepal, Jhala Nath Khanal, Bhim Rawal, Ghanashyam Bhusal, Surendra Pandey, Met Mani Chaudhari, Pabitra Niroula, Jhapat Rawal, Yagya Raj Sunuwar, Jeevan Ram Shrestha, Bhawani Khapung, Birodh Khatiwada, Som Prasad Pandey, Narayan Khatiwada, Ganesh Pahari, Jaya Kumar Rai, Dipak Prakash Bhatta, Yogesh Bhattarai, Hira Chandra KC, Pushpa Kumari Karna Kayastha, Kalyani Khadka, Laxmi Kumari Chaudhari, Krishna Lal Maharjan, Sarala Kumari Yadav, Nira Devi Jairu, Ram Kuamri Jhakri and Mukunda Neupane.Oli had earlier suspended a few leaders including Nepal from the party for six months.',\n",
       " 'As he rounds out his first 100 days in office, US President Joe Bidens focus on reigning in the coronavirus during the early months of his administration seems to have paid off He can check off nearly all his campaign promises centered on the pandemic.Biden has delivered on a number of his biggest campaign pledges focused on climate change and the economy as well. But some issues have proven to be tougher for the administration  including immigration, where Biden is grappling with how to enact promised reforms in the face of a steep increase in unaccompanied minors seeking to cross the border. On some of his promises, Biden is waiting for Congress to act.Where Biden stands on some of his key promisesIMMIGRATION Raise refugee cap to 125,000, up from the 15,000 set by President Donald Trump.Nowhere close. The White House first said it would stick to Trumps 15,000 cap due to humanitarian concerns. After facing backlash from Democrats, it shifted gears and said Biden would increase the historically low cap on refugees set by Trump  but probably not all the way to the 62,500 that Biden previously had planned. And the numbers actually admitted this year are likely to be closer to 15,000. Surge humanitarian resources to the border and encourage publicprivate partnerships to deal with an increase in migration there.Yes, but is it enough The Department of Homeland Security has deployed the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help deal with the crisis a major increase of border arrivals, and Biden signed an executive order asking officials to prepare plans for using humanitarian resources there. He has yet to establish any new publicprivate partnerships. The largest number of unaccompanied children ever at the border created massive overcrowding at Customs and Border Protection facilities and set off a mad scramble for temporary space at convention centers, military bases and other large venues. Reform the U.S. asylum system.Incomplete. Biden signed an executive order in February directing his officials to craft a strategy for migration, including refugees and asylum seekers. Biden has promised to unveil a new humane asylum system but he and his aides have been mum on timing and offered no specifics. Hes eliminated some Trumpera policies, like a requirement that new asylum seekers to wait in Mexico. But he has kept a controversial Trumpera policy that allows Customs and Border Protection to expel undocumented migrants to avoid the spread of COVID19. And Biden has yet to articulate a plan to manage asylum flows beyond proposing that billions of dollars be spent to address root causes in Central America. Deliver a comprehensive immigration reform bill to Congress within his first 100 days.Done. End travel restrictions on people from a number of Muslimmajority countries.Done. Reverse Trumpera order expanding criteria for deporting immigrants and return to Obamaera principle of prioritizing deportations of immigrants posing a national security, border security or public health risk.Done. Stop funding and building the border wall.Done. Reverse Trumps public charge rule discouraging immigrants from using public benefits.Done. Restore the Obamaera principle of deporting foreigners who are seen as posing a national security threat or who have committed crimes in addition to the crime of illegal entry.Done. Freeze deportations for 100 days.Attempted, but blocked in court. Streamline and improve the naturalization process for green card holders.In progress. Biden signed an executive order in February ordering a plan to improve the naturalization process, and the Department of Homeland Security has since revoked some Trumpera rules, sought public input into naturalization barriers and reverted to a 2008 version of the U.S. civics test for applicants, considered more accessible than the Trumpera revamp. End family separation and create task force to reunite families separated at the border.In progress. Biden signed executive orders ending the policy and establishing a task force focused on reuniting families. The task force is making slow progress as it pores over thousands of records. Order a review of Temporary Protected StatusNo review has been ordered, but Bidens Department of Homeland Security has granted TPS for Venezuelans and Burmese, extended it for Syrians and extended a related program for Liberians. Convene a regional meeting of leaders, including officials from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico and Canada, to address the factors driving migration and propose a regional resettlement solution.Not yet. Vice President Kamala Harris, tasked with dealing with the root causes of migration, has spoken to the leaders of Mexico and Guatemala, but no regional meeting is on the horizon. Protect those often described as dreamers  young immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents  and their families by reinstating DACA, the Obamaera policy defending thems from deportation.Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in March his agency was issuing a rule to preserve and fortify DACA, but the policy faces a Texas court challenge that could invalidate protections for those often decribed as dreamers. Ensure that personnel within Immigration and Customs Enforcement and within Customs and Border Protection abide by professional standards and are held accountable for inhumane treatment.Biden included funding for training and investigating misconduct in his immigration bill and in the budget he proposed to Congress. His administration has faced questions about allegations of abuse in at least one Texas facility, which are being investigated. End prolonged migrant detention and invest in a casemanagement system to process people.Theres been no announcement of added investments in casemanagement systems. The administration did roll out plans to release parents and children within 72 hours of their arrival in the United States in March. Officials subsequently acknowledged that hundreds of children have been held by Border Patrol for much longer, due to an increase in unaccompanied minors arriving at the border and a lack of facilities to house them.DOMESTIC POLICY Reverse transgender military ban.Done. Establish police oversight board.Abandoned. The Biden administration said it was scrapping the idea, after consultations with civil rights groups and police unions that said it would be counterproductive. Direct attorney general to deliver a list of recommendations for restructuring the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and other Justice Department agencies to better enforce gun lawsNot yet. Direct FBI to issue report on delays in background checks for gun purchases.Not yet. Reauthorize Violence Against Women ActRequires congressional action. Sign Equality ActRequires congressional action. Create Cabinetlevel working group focused on promoting union organizing tasked with delivering a plan to increase union density and address economic inequalityNot yet.COVID19 Rejoin World Health OrganizationDone. Ensure 100 million vaccines have been administered before the end of his first 100 days, later increased to 200 million.Done. Increase access to testing and establish pandemic testing board.Done. Issue mask mandate on federal property and ask Americans to wear masks for 100 days.Done. Extend nationwide restrictions on home evictions and foreclosures.Done. Continue to pause student loan payments.Done. Safely reopen a majority of K8 schools.According to data collected by Burbio, a schooltracking site, as of April 18 62 of schools offered inperson learning every day. Its unclear what percentage of those schools are elementary schools. Push for passage of 1.9 trillion COVID19 relief legislative package announced last week.Done the bill passed in March.CLIMATE Rescind Keystone XL oil pipeline permit, protect the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve, rejoin the Paris Climate agreement and embrace the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol to reduce harmful hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs.Done. Convene climate world summit and persuade nations to set more ambitious emissions pledges.Done. Ban new oil and gas leases on federal lands and offshore waters.Sort of  hes imposed an indefinite moratorium on new oil and gas leases on federal lands and waters. Reverse Trump rollbacks on 100 public health and environmental rules.In progress. Biden signed an executive order on Inauguration Day ordering a review of Trumpera rules on the environment, public health and science, and has begun the process of rolling back some.ECONOMY Roll back Trumps 2017 cuts to corporate tax rates.In progress. Biden has proposed raising the corporate tax rate to 28 from the 21 rate set by Trumps 2017 overhaul of the tax code. Provide 2,000 in direct payments as part of COVID19 relief.Done. The aid package approved right before Biden became president offered 600 in direct payments to eligible Americans. Biden said the payment should have been 2,000. His 1.9 trillion relief package included 1,400 in additional direct payments, which with the prior round adds up to 2,000. Pause federal student debt payments.Done. Order a review of U.S. supply chains.Done.FOREIGN POLICY End the forever wars in Afghanistan and the Middle East and terminate U.S. involvement in the Yemen civil war.In progress. Biden announced that the American troop withdrawal from Afghanistan would begin by May 1 and the redeployment would be done no later than Sept. 11. Biden announced he was ending American support for the fiveyear Saudi Arabialed military offensive in Yemen. Put human rights at the center of foreign policy.Mixed. Biden has directly raised concerns with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Hong Kong, human rights abuses against Uyghur and ethnic minorities in the western Xinjiang province, and its actions toward Taiwan. Hes repeatedly raised concerns about the jailing and treatment of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. But Biden declined to hold Saudi Arabias crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, directly responsible for the killing of U.S.based journalist Jamal Khashoggi even after the publication of U.S. intelligence showing Salman approved of the hit. Improving relations with allies who had rocky relations with Trump.Mostly accomplished. Allies like Canadas Justin Trudeau and Germanys Angela Merkel, who had stormy relationships with Trump, have praised Biden for his efforts reclaim U.S. leadership on climate issues, and leaders in the IndoPacific have been pleased by early efforts at coordination on China policy. Reversing the embrace of dictators and tyrants like Putin and Kim Jong Un.Mostly accomplished. Biden has levied two rounds of sanctions against the Russians. His administration decided to be measured in its approach with Putin and has said that hes interested in finding areas where the U.S. and Russia can find common ground. Bidens team acknowledges they have sought to reengage with North Korea, but have been rebuffed. Quickly rejoin the nuclear deal with Iran so long as Tehran comes back into compliance.Mixed. Indirect talks are under way among other signatories of the 2015 deal, including British, German, French, Chinese and Russian officials, with American officials down the hall. But the path forward is less than certain as Tehran has thus far refused to come into compliance with the old deal without sanctions relief and it recently began enriching uranium to its highest purity ever. Recognize World War Iera atrocities against Armenians as genocide.Completed. As a candidate, Biden said, if elected, hed make it U.S. policy to recognize the killings and mass deportations by Ottoman Empire forces of hundreds of thousands of Armenians more than a century ago  something past presidents have avoided doing out of concern of angering strategic ally Turkey. Biden followed through on the promise on the annual commemoration Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day. Turkey swiftly condemned the move.',\n",
       " 'CPNUML Chairman and Prime Minister PM KP Sharma Oli has discussed the possibility of noconfidence motion against his government by the opposition parties including Nepali Congress NC with UML leaders at Baluwatar on Sunday.There are efforts to bring noconfidence motion. The opposition parties bringing it is not a big deal. But there are efforts for floorcrossing at several places like that in Karnali.

The decision will be sent to the Karnali provincial assembly in writing, the leader added. The four out of nine UML lawmakers from the KhanalNepal faction in Karnali had crossed the floor to vote for the government of CPN Maoist Center during the floor test on April 16.Jwala was finance minister and Buda industry, tourism, forest and environment minister in the Shahi Cabinet before resigning following withdrawal of support for the government by UML.Jwala had told Setopati after the floor test that only four UML lawmakers crossed the floor as that was enough to save the government and added that the four were cognizant of the fact that they would lose the post of lawmaker if they crossed the floor.The confidence motion of Chief Minister CM Shahi received 22 votes while just 15 votes were cast in opposition.The six Nepali Congress NC lawmakers also voted for the government. CPN Maoist Center has 12 seats in the provincial assembly while UML has 20 including the speaker. The speaker and one RPP lawmaker did not participate in voting.',\n",

       " 'Russias defense minister on Thursday ordered troops back to their permanent bases following massive drills in Crimea that involved dozens of navy ships, hundreds of warplanes and thousands of troops in a show of force amid tensions with Ukraine.After watching the drills, Russian Defense Minister Shoigu declared the maneuvers over and ordered the military to pull the troops taking part in maneuvers in Crimea and western Russia back to their permanent bases.I consider the goals of the snap check of readiness fulfilled, Shoigu said. The troops have shown their defense capability and I decided to complete the drills in the South and Western military districts.The Russian troop buildup near Ukraine that came amid increasing violations of a ceasefire in Ukraines east has raised concerns in the West, which urged the Kremlin to pull its forces back.The Russian military hasnt reported the number of additional troops that have been moved to Crimea and parts of southwestern Russia near Ukraine, and it wasnt immediately clear from Shoigus statement if all of them will now be pulled back.The U.S. and NATO has said that the Russian buildup near Ukraine was the largest since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and threw its support behind separatists in eastern Ukraine.The Russian Defense Ministry said the maneuvers in Crimea involved more than 60 ships, over 10,000 troops, around 200 aircraft and about 1,200 military vehicles.The exercise featured the landing of more than 2,000 paratroopers and 60 military vehicles on Thursday. Fighter jets covered the airborne operation.Shoigu flew in a helicopter over the Opuk firing range in Crimea to oversee the exercise. He later declared the drills over, but ordered the military to stand ready to respond to any adverse developments during NATOs Defender Europe 2021 exercise.Last week, Russia has announced that it would close broad areas of the Black Sea near Crimea to foreign navy ships and state vessels until November, a move that drew Ukrainian protests and raised Western concerns. Russia also announced restrictions on flights near Crimea this week, arguing that they fully conform with the international law.Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba warned Tuesday that the Russian buildup across the border is continuing and is expected to reach a combined force of over 120,000 troops in about a week and urged the West to beef up sanctions against Moscow.Moscow has rejected Ukrainian and Western concerns about the buildup, arguing that its free to deploy its forces anywhere on the Russian territory and charging that they dont threaten anyone. But at the same time, the Kremlin sternly warned Ukrainian authorities against trying to use force to retake control of the rebel east, where seven years of fighting have killed more than 14,000, saying that Russia could be forced to intervene to protect civilians in the region.Amid the tensions, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Wednesday signed a law allowing the callup of reservists for military service without announcing a mobilization. The new law will allow to quickly equip the military with reservists, significantly increasing their combat effectiveness during military aggression, Zelenskyys office said in a statement.',\n",

We are preparing to bring noconfidence motion against PM but time has yet to ripen. We will have to closely analyze the unfolding political developments and calculate the number of lawmakers to sign in the noconfidence motion, a leader close to Deuba confided with Setopati.NC feels that CPN Maoist Center has become clearer on the issue but indecision by Janata Samajwadi Party JSP has delayed things. JSP is currently divided on whether to support Oli or not. JSP leaders Baburam Bhattarai and Upendra Yadav, coming from erstwhile Federal Socialist Forum Nepal, have publicly demanded toppling of Oli government while leaders from the erstwhile Rastriya Janata Party like Thakur and Rajendra Mahato are negotiating with Oli.Thakur and Mahato will ally with Oli. Upendra Yadav and Bhattarai are closer to us in agenda and are adamant they should not ally with Oli at any cost, the leader added. Bringing of noconfidence motion will be delayed further if JSP doesnt take decision. But the picture will be clearers if JSP decides to ally with Oli or NC.NC leaders feel JSP can no longer remain united. We feel that Bhattarai and Yadav will form a new party if Thakur and Mahato ally with Oli, and Thakur and Mahato will form a new party if Bhattarai and Yadav decide to ally with NC. This may become clearer within a week, the leader stated.NC feels that Oli will be stronger if he successfully faces noconfidence motion and is, therefore, concerned that it cannot muster the necessary numbers if JSP splits. It hopes that the KhanalNepal faction will cross the floor to help the main opposition party but recent efforts by Oli to reach out to the dissidents can put paid to that hope.The winter session of the parliament was hurriedly ended after we started preparations to bring noconfidence motion. Oli has panicked and therefore talked with Nepal yesterday. He doesnt intend to punish the 27 lawmakers of the KhanalNepal faction with whom he sought explanation. He is trying to become stronger by pretending to resolve the dispute, the leader claimed. NC does not want Oli to start the process of seeking floor test though and wants to bring noconfidence motion instead. Because seeking vote of confidence is a lengthy process. There will be the danger of this government bringing the next budget. If we bring noconfidence motion and pass it, the new government will be formed soon, the leader reasoned.NC Senior Leader Ram Chandra Paudel has been slamming Deuba for dallying to topple the government accusing the main opposition leader of missing an opportunity even in the past. But Deuba is not in a hurry and wants to bring noconfidence motion only if it becomes successful.The leader claimed that the noconfidence motion would already have failed if NC had not wisely calculated and forecasted the developments before bringing the motion.',\n",

       " 'Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who is in the third week of a hunger strike while behind bars, was moved to a hospital in another prison after his doctor said he could be near death, his lawyer said Monday.Navalny was transferred Sunday from a penal colony east of Moscow to a prison hospital in Vladimir, a city 180 kilometers 110 miles east of the capital, lawyer Alexei Liptser said after visiting the politician on Monday afternoon.Yesterday he was really unwell.  Given the test results and the overall state of his health, it was decided to transfer him here. In the evening, he became significantly worse, Liptser said. While Navalny was able to meet with him Monday, he continued his hunger strike and in general his look indicates he is really unwell, the lawyer added.Russias state penitentiary service FSIN did not report the decision to transfer Navalny until Monday morning and a statement it released said he had agreed to take vitamin therapy.Liptser said he didnt have enough time with his client to confirm that They were searching him ahead of our meeting longer than our meeting had lasted. He was outraged by this. Therefore, we couldnt discuss anything, apart from what has happened to him.The prison service statement said Navalnys condition was deemed satisfactory. But the opposition leaders physician, Dr. Yaroslav Ashikhmin, said Saturday that test results provided by the family show Navalny has sharply elevated levels of potassium, which can bring on cardiac arrest, as well as heightened creatinine levels that indicate impaired kidney function.MORE STORIES EU warns spark could set off escalation at Ukraine borders Navalnys team calls protests amid reports of failing health Navalnys doctor Putin critic could die at any momentOur patient could die at any moment, he said in a Facebook post.Reports about his rapidly declining health drew international outrage and calls urging Russian authorities to give adequate medical help to Navalny, who is President Vladimir Putins fiercest opponent. European Union foreign ministers were assessing the blocs strategy toward Russia in wake of the news.White House press secretary Jen Psaki called for his release and that he must be treated humanely, adding that U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan discussed Navalny with Nikolai Patrushev, head of the Russian Security Council.What happens to Mr. Navalny in the custody of the Russian government is the responsibility of the Russian government, and that they will be held accountable by the international community, she added.Navalny was arrested in January upon his return from Germany, where he had spent five months recovering from a nerve agent poisoning he blames on the Kremlin  an accusation Russian officials have rejected. His arrest triggered massive protests across Russia, the biggest show of defiance in recent years. Soon after, a court ordered him to serve 2 12 years in prison on a 2014 embezzlement conviction that the European Court of Human Rights deemed to be arbitrary and manifestly unreasonable.Navalny began a hunger strike to protest the refusal to let his doctors visit when he began experiencing severe back pain and a loss of feeling in his legs. The penitentiary service has said Navalny was getting all the medical help he needs.In response to the alarming news about Navalnys health, his team has called for a nationwide rally Wednesday, the same day that Putin is scheduled to deliver his annual state of the nation address. According to a website dedicated to the protests, demonstrations were being planned in 77 Russian cities as of Monday afternoon.The Interior Ministry in a statement urged Russians not to take part in unauthorized rallies, citing coronavirus risks and alleging that some destructiveminded participants might provoke unrest. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said police will treat any unauthorized protests as illegal. In the past, security forces have violently broken up demonstrations.Already, Russian authorities have taken their crackdown on Navalnys allies and supporters to a new level, with the Moscow prosecutors office last week petitioning a court to label as extremist groups Navalnys Foundation for Fighting Corruption and his network of regional offices.Human rights advocates say if that happens, both the foundation and the regional offices would be outlawed, paralyzing their operations, and those who work for either could be prosecuted. Donating money to the groups  something thousands of Russians have done regularly in recent years  would also become a criminal offense punishable by prison.For now, several Navalny allies have dismissed as insufficient the move to move him to the prison hospital. Ivan Zhdanov, head of the Foundation for Fighting Corruption, tweeted that the transfer takes Navalny merely to another tormenting colony, just with a big inpatient facility, where gravely ill are being transferred.Dr. Anastasia Vasilyeva, head of the Navalnybacked Alliance of Doctors union and also his personal physician, noted that it was not a hospital where a diagnosis can be determined and treatment can be prescribed for his ailments, but rather a prison where tuberculosis is being treated.She again called for the prison to let her and other physicians see him, but Liptser said that prison officials told Navalny he wont be allowed a visit from civilian doctors.Since last month, the politician has been serving his sentence in a penal colony notorious for its harsh conditions.Navalny has complained about being sleepdeprived because guards conduct hourly checks on him at night, and he said he developed severe back pain and numbness in his legs within weeks of his transfer to the colony. His demands for a visit from an independent civilian physician were rebuffed by prison officials, and he began the hunger strike March 31.In a wry message Friday from prison, Navalny said authorities threatened to forcefeed him imminently, using a straitjacket and other pleasures.Full Coverage RussiaThe French newspaper Le Monde on Friday published a letter to Putin signed by dozens of cultural figures  including writers Salman Rushdie and Mario Vargas Llosa, singer Patti Smith and actors Benedict Cumberbatch and Kristin Scott Thomas  urging him to give Navalny access to proper medical care.On Monday, Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, Dunja Mijatovi, reiterated her calls for Navalnys release and to give him full access to medical care in light of his serious health deterioration.',\n",

It has instructed all the district committees to send details about active membership to the center by April 28.The main opposition party had to complete distribution and renewal of active membership by March 23 as per the schedule but was extended it till April 12 after nine district committees did not even start it by the end of the deadline. Sindhupalchowk and a few other districts did not complete it even by April 12 due to unfinished integration works. Bijay Kumar Gachchhadar had quit NC on February 1, 2008 and joined the then Madhesi Janadhikar Forum before the first Constituent Assembly election.

       " 'Myanmars junta on Saturday released more than 23,000 prisoners to mark the traditional new year holiday, including at least three political detainees, and the military leader behind the February coup confirmed he would attend a regional summit later this month.It wasnt immediately clear if those released included prodemocracy activists who were detained for protesting the coup. State broadcaster MRTV said that junta chief Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing had pardoned 23,047 prisoners, including 137 foreigners who will be deported from Myanmar. He also reduced sentences for others.As security forces continued the deadly crackdown, unconfirmed but credible accounts with photos on social media said that three people were killed Saturday in the central city of Mogok, in Myanmars gem mining region.According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, which monitors casualties and arrests, government forces have killed at least 728 protesters and bystanders since the takeover. The group says 3,141 people, including ousted civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, are in detention.Among those released Saturday from Yangons Insein Prison were at least three political prisoners who were jailed in 2019. They are members of the Peacock Generation performing troupe who were arrested during that years new year celebrations for skits that poked fun at military representatives in Parliament and military involvement in business.Their traditional style of acting is called Thangyat, a mashup of poetry, comedy and music with a sharp undertone of satire. Several members of the troupe were convicted under a law banning circulation of information that could endanger or demoralize members of the military. The actors may have drawn the special wrath of the military because they performed in army uniforms.Several members were also found guilty of online defamation for livestreaming their performances. Its not clear if all of them were released.Another freed prisoner was Ross Dunkley, an Australian newspaper entrepreneur sentenced in 2019 to 13 years on charges of drug possession. His release was confirmed by his exwife Cynda Johnston, The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper reported.Dunkley cofounded the The Myanmar Times, an Englishlanguage daily, but was forced to give up his share in it. He became wellknown for cofounding or acquiring Englishlanguage publications in formerly socialist states that were seeking foreign investment, but was sometimes criticized for doing business with authoritarian regimes.Early prisoner releases are customary during major holidays, and this is the second batch the ruling junta has announced since taking power.Following the release of more than 23,000 convicts to mark Union Day on Feb. 12, there were reports on social media that some were recruited by the authorities to carry out violence at night in residential areas to spread panic, especially by setting fires. Some areas responded by setting up their own neighborhood watch groups.In March, more than 600 people who were imprisoned for demonstrating against the coup were also released from Insein Prison, a rare conciliatory gesture by the military that appeared aimed at placating the protest movement. They were mostly young people caught in sweeps of street rallies while those considered protest leaders were kept locked up.Neither the military government nor those opposed to it show any signs of backing off. Western nations have tried to pressure the military through diplomatic and economic sanctions with little effect.Myanmars Southeast Asian neighbors, concerned about the prospects for regional instability, are also trying to get the junta to start back on the path to restoring democracy, or at least end its violent repression.A spokesman for Thailands Foreign Ministry in Bangkok said Saturday that junta chief Min Aung Hlaing has confirmed he will attend a summit meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations  ASEAN  expected to be held on April 24.Tanee Sangrat said in a text message to journalists that Brunei, the current chair of the 10nation body, confirmed it had proposed the date for a meeting at the groups secretariat in the Indonesian capital Jakarta. Indonesia has taken the lead in calling for the special meeting to discuss the crisis in Myanmar.',\n",
       " 'The United States and China, the worlds two biggest carbon polluters, have agreed to cooperate with other countries to curb climate change, just days before President Joe Biden hosts a virtual summit of world leaders to discuss the issue.The agreement was reached by U.S. special envoy for climate John Kerry and his Chinese counterpart Xie Zhenhua during two days of talks in Shanghai last week, the State Department said in a statement Saturday.The United States and China are committed to cooperating with each other and with other countries to tackle the climate crisis, which must be addressed with the seriousness and urgency that it demands, the joint statement said.China and the United States are the worlds top carbon polluters, pumping out nearly half of the fossil fuel fumes that are warming the planets atmosphere. Their cooperation is key to a success of global efforts to curb climate change, but frayed ties over human rights, trade and Chinas territorial claims to Taiwan and the South China Sea have been threatening to undermine such efforts.Kerrys Shanghai trip marked the highestlevel travel to China by a U.S. official since Biden took office in January. From Shaghai, the former secretary of state flew to South Korea for talks.Biden has invited 40 world leaders, including Chinese President Xi Jinping, to the April 2223 summit. The U.S. and other countries are expected to announce more ambitious national targets for cutting carbon emissions ahead of or at the meeting, along with pledging financial help for climate efforts by less wealthy nations.Its unclear how much Kerrys China visit would promote U.S.China cooperation on climate issues.When Kerry was still in Shanghai, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng signaled Friday that China is unlikely to make any new pledges at next weeks summit.For a big country with 1.4 billion people, these goals are not easily delivered, Le said during an interview with The Associated Press in Beijing. Some countries are asking China to achieve the goals earlier. I am afraid this is not very realistic.On whether Xi would join the summit, Le said the Chinese side is actively studying the matter.During a video meeting with German and French leaders Friday, Xi also said that climate change should not become a geopolitical chip, a target for attacking other countries or an excuse for trade barriers, though he called for closer cooperation on the issue, according to the official Xinhua News Agency.Biden, who has said that fighting global warming is among his highest priorities, had the United States rejoin the Paris climate accord in the first hours of his presidency, undoing the U.S. withdrawal ordered by predecessor Donald Trump.Major emitters of greenhouse gases are preparing for the next U.N. climate summit taking place in Glasgow, U.K., in November. The summit aims to relaunch global efforts to keep rising global temperatures to below 1.5 degrees Celsius 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit as agreed in the Paris accord.According to the U.S.China statement, the two countries would enhance their respective actions and cooperating in multilateral processes, including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement.It said both countries are firmly committed to working together and with other Parties to strengthen implementation of the Paris Agreement.',\n",
       " 'Iran began enriching uranium Friday to its highestever purity, edging close to weaponsgrade levels, as it attempts to pressure negotiators in Vienna during talks on restoring its nuclear deal with world powers after an attack on its main enrichment site.A top official said only a few grams an hour of uranium gas would be enriched up to 60 purity  triple its previous level but at a quantity far lower than what the Islamic Republic had been able to produce. Iran also is enriching at an aboveground facility at its Natanz nuclear site already visited by international inspectors, not deep within underground halls hardened to withstand airstrikes.The narrow scope of the new enrichment provides Iran with a way to quickly deescalate if it chooses, experts say, but time is narrowing. An Iranian presidential election looms on the horizon as Tehran already threatens to limit international inspections. Israel, suspected of carrying out Sundays sabotage at Natanz, also could act again amid a longrunning shadow war between the two Middle East rivals.Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, Irans parliament speaker, announced the higher enrichment on Twitter.The young and Godbelieving Iranian scientists managed to achieve a 60 enriched uranium product, Qalibaf said. I congratulate the brave nation of Islamic Iran on this success. The Iranian nations willpower is miraculous and can defuse any conspiracy.The head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, the countrys civilian nuclear arm, later acknowledged the move to 60. Ali Akbar Salehi told Iranian state television the centrifuges now produce 9 grams an hour, but that would drop to 5 grams an hour in the coming days.Any enrichment level that we desire is in our reach at the moment and we can do it at any time we want, Salehi said.It wasnt clear why the first announcement came from Qalibaf, a hardline former leader in the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard already named as a potential presidential candidate in Irans upcoming June election.While 60 is higher than any level Iran previously enriched uranium, it is still lower than weaponsgrade levels of 90. Iran had been enriching up to 20  and even that was a short technical step to weaponsgrade. The deal limited Irans enrichment to 3.67.The International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors Irans nuclear program, did not respond to a request for comment. Earlier this week, it sent its inspectors to Natanz and confirmed Iran was preparing to begin 60 enrichment at an aboveground facility at the site.Israel, which has twice bombed Mideast countries to stop their nuclear programs, plans to hold a meeting of its top security officials Sunday over the Iranian announcement.Israel is determined to defend itself against any attempt to harm its sovereignty or citizens, and will do whatever it takes to prevent this radical and antiSemitic regime from acquiring nuclear weapons, Israeli Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi said in Cyprus.Iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful, though the West and the IAEA say Tehran had an organized military nuclear program up until the end of 2003. An annual U.S. intelligence report released Tuesday maintained the longtime American assessment that Iran isnt currently trying to build a nuclear bomb.Iran previously had said it could use uranium enriched up to 60 for nuclearpowered ships. However, the Islamic Republic currently has no such ships in its navy.The threat of higher enrichment by Iran already had drawn criticism from the U.S. and three European nations in the deal  France, Germany and the United Kingdom. On Friday, European Union spokesman Peter Stano called Irans decision a very worrisome development.There is no credible explanation or civilian justification for such an action on the side of Iran, Stano said. The Vienna talks aim to make sure that we go back from such steps that bring Iran further away from delivering on its commitments and obligations.Diplomats reconvened Friday in Vienna, with more talks planned Saturday, Russian representative Mikhail Ulyanov said. Chinese negotiator Wang Qun earlier called for doing away with all disruptive factors by moving forward as swiftly as we can on the work of negotiations, especially by zeroing in on sanction lifting.The 2015 nuclear deal, which former President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the U.S. from in 2018, prevented Iran from stockpiling enough highenriched uranium to be able to pursue a nuclear weapon if it chose in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.In Washington, President Joe Biden said Tehrans latest step was contrary to the deal. We do not support and do not think its at all helpful, he said. But he added that the Vienna talks had not been sidetracked.We are nonetheless pleased that Iran has agreed to continue to engage in indirect discussions with us on how we move forward and what is needed to get back into the nuclear deal, he said. Its premature to make a judgment as to what the outcome will be, but were still talking.The weekend attack at Natanz was initially described only as a blackout in its electrical grid  but later Iranian officials began calling it an attack.One Iranian official referred to several thousand centrifuges damaged and destroyed in a state TV interview. However, no other official has offered that figure and no images of the aftermath have been released.In the coming weeks, Iran has threatened to further impede IAEA inspections and potentially destroy video recordings it now holds of its facilities. Meanwhile, it continues to use advanced centrifuges and gain knowhow in high enrichment, something that worries nonproliferation experts.Because the deal has started to unravel, Iran has begun to acquire more knowledge about how to operate more advanced machines, said Daryl G. Kimball, the executive director of the Washingtonbased Arms Control Association. This particular operation, enriching to 60, is going to give it even more information.Borrowing a term used to describe diluting highenriched uranium, Kimball added That knowledge cannot be downblended. It cannot be reversed.',\n",

There are measures to control benchsetting. Benchsetting is either by the Chief Justice of SC or by chief judge of high courts while assigning the bench. Cases are already assigned in district courts. So, there is no setting, Chudal replied as if acknowledging the corrupt practice instead of refuting it.

       " 'The Biden administration announced Thursday the U.S. is expelling 10 Russian diplomats and imposing sanctions against dozens of companies and other people, holding the Kremlin accountable for interference in last years presidential election and the hacking of federal agencies.The sweeping measures are meant to punish Russia for actions that U.S. officials say cut to the core of American democracy and to deter future acts by imposing economic costs on Moscow, including by targeting its ability to borrow money. The sanctions are certain to exacerbate tensions with Russia, which promised a response, even as President Joe Biden said the administration could have taken even more punitive measures but chose not to in the interests of maintaining stability.We cannot allow a foreign power to interfere in our democratic process with impunity, Biden said at the White House.Sanctions against six Russian companies that support the countrys cyber efforts represent the first retaliatory measures against the Kremlin for the hack familiarly known as the SolarWinds breach, with the U.S. explicitly linking the intrusion to the SVR, a Russian intelligence agency. Though such intelligencegathering missions are not uncommon, officials said they were determined to respond because of the operations broad scope and the high cost of the intrusion on private companies.The U.S. also announced sanctions on 32 individuals and entities accused of attempting to interfere in last years presidential election, including by spreading disinformation. U.S. officials alleged in a declassified report last month that Russian President Vladimir Putin authorized influence operations to help Donald Trump in his unsuccessful bid for reelection as president, though theres no evidence Russia or anyone else changed votes.The actions, foreshadowed by the administration for weeks, signal a harder line against Putin, whom Trump was reluctant to criticize even as his administration pursued sanctions against Moscow. They are the administrations second major foreign policy move in two days, following the announcement of troop withdrawals from Afghanistan. Until now, Biden has largely focused on the coronavirus pandemic and economy in his first months in office.Biden said Thursday that when he advised Putin days earlier of the forthcoming measures  which included expulsion of the 10 diplomats, some of them representatives of Russian intelligence services  he told the Russian leader that we could have gone further but I chose not to do so. I chose to be proportionate.We want, he said, a stable, predictable relationship.Even so, Russian officials spoke of a swift response, with Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov warning that a series of retaliatory measures will come in the nearest time.Other American measures are expected as well, though the administration is not likely to announce them. Officials have been advising that their response to Russia would be in ways both seen and unseen.The sanctions announced Thursday are the latest in a series of actions that successive presidential administrations have taken to counter Russian behavior seen as antagonistic. It is unclear whether the new U.S. actions will result in changed behavior, especially since past measures by the U.S.  both Trump and Barack Obama expelled individual diplomats during their presidencies  have failed to bring an end to Russian hacking.But experts suggest this latest round, even while not guaranteed to curb cyberattacks, might have more resonance because of its financial impact The order makes it more difficult for Russia to borrow money by barring U.S. banks from buying Russian bonds directly from the Russian Central Bank, Russian National Wealth Fund and Finance Ministry. It could complicate Russian efforts to raise capital and give companies pause about doing business in Russia.The impact of the sanctions and the U.S. willingness to impose costs will be weighed by Putin as he evaluates his next steps, though he is unlikely to make a 180 degree pivot in his behavior, said Daniel Fried, a former assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian Affairs.The issue is, how can we push back against Putins aggression, while at the same time keeping open channels of communication and continuing to cooperate with Russia in areas of mutual interest, Fried said. And it seems to me the Biden administration has done a pretty good job framing up the relationship in exactly this way.Eric Lorber, a former Treasury Department official now with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said the administration, is surely trying to balance putting pressure on Russia, pushing back on Russia, while at the same time, not engaging in fullfledged economic warfare.The White House did not impose sanctions related to separate reports that Russia encouraged the Taliban to attack U.S. and allied troops in Afghanistan, saying instead that Biden was using diplomatic, military and intelligence channels to respond.Reports of alleged bounties surfaced last year, with the Trump administration coming under fire for not raising the issue directly with Russia. Administration officials said Thursday they had only low to moderate confidence in that intelligence, in part because of the ways in which the information was obtained, including from interrogations of Afghan detainees.Among the companies sanctioned are websites that U.S. officials say operate as fronts for Russian intelligence agencies and spread disinformation, including articles alleging widespread voter fraud in 2020. The individuals who were targeted include Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian and Ukrainian political consultant who worked with former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and who was indicted in special counsel Robert Muellers Russia investigation.The Treasury Department said on Thursday that Kilimnik had provided sensitive information on polling and campaign strategy to Russian intelligence services. That went further than Muellers office, which said in its 2019 report that it had been unable to determine what Kilimnik had done with the polling data after getting it from the Trump campaign.Also on the sanctions list was the Kremlins first deputy chief of staff, Alexei Gromov, several individuals linked to Yevgeny Prigozhin, a businessman with close ties to Russias president, nicknamed Putins chef for serving Kremlin functions, and several front companies the U.S. says helped Prigozhin evade sanctions imposed earlier.Biden informed Putin that the sanctions were coming earlier this week. Administration officials have made clear in their contacts with the Russia side that they are hoping to avoid a downward spiral in the relationship, according to a senior administration official who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity following the sanctions announcement.The two leaders had a tense call in which Biden told Putin to deescalate tensions following a Russian military buildup on Ukraines border, and said the U.S. would act firmly in defense of its national interests regarding Russian intrusions and election interference.In a television interview last month, Biden replied I do when asked if he thought Putin was a killer. He said the days of the U.S. rolling over to Putin were done. Putin later recalled his ambassador to the U.S. and pointed at the U.S. history of slavery and slaughtering Native Americans and the atomic bombing of Japan in World War II.U.S. officials are still grappling with the aftereffects of the SolarWinds intrusion, which affected agencies including the Treasury, Justice and Homeland Security departments. The breach exposed vulnerabilities in the supply chain as well as weaknesses in the federal governments own cyber defenses.',\n",

       " 'Iran on Sunday described a blackout at its underground Natanz atomic facility an act of nuclear terrorism, raising regional tensions as world powers and Tehran continue to negotiate over its tattered nuclear deal.While there was no immediate claim of responsibility, suspicion fell immediately on Israel, where its media nearly uniformly reported a devastating cyberattack orchestrated by the country caused the blackout.If Israel was responsible, it further heightens tensions between the two nations, already engaged in a shadow conflict across the wider Middle East. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who met Sunday with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, has vowed to do everything in his power to stop the nuclear deal.Details remained few about what happened early Sunday morning at the facility, which initially was described as a blackout caused by the electrical grid feeding its aboveground workshops and underground enrichment halls.Ali Akbar Salehi, the Americaneducated head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, who once served as the countrys foreign minister, offered what appeared to be the harshest comments of his long career, which included the assassination of nuclear scientists a decade ago. Iran blames Israel for those killings as well.He pledged to seriously improve his nations nuclear technology while working to lift international sanctions.Salehis comments to state TV did not explain what happened at the facility, but his words suggested a serious disruption.While condemning this desperate move, the Islamic Republic of Iran emphasizes the need for a confrontation by the international bodies and the International Atomic Energy Agency against this nuclear terrorism, Salehi said.The IAEA, the United Nations body that monitors Tehrans atomic program, earlier said it was aware of media reports about the incident at Natanz and had spoken with Iranian officials about it. The agency did not elaborate.However, Natanz has been targeted by sabotage in the past. The Stuxnet computer virus, discovered in 2010 and widely believed to be a joint U.S.Israeli creation, once disrupted and destroyed Iranian centrifuges at Natanz amid an earlier period of Western fears about Tehrans program.Natanz suffered a mysterious explosion at its advanced centrifuge assembly plant in July that authorities later described as sabotage. Iran now is rebuilding that facility deep inside a nearby mountain. Iran also blamed Israel for the November killing of a scientist who began the countrys military nuclear program decades earlier.Multiple Israeli media outlets reported Sunday that an Israeli cyberattack caused the blackout in Natanz. Public broadcaster Kan said the Mossad was behind the attack. Channel 12 TV cited experts as estimating the attack shut down entire sections of the facility.While the reports offered no sourcing for their information, Israeli media maintains a close relationship with the countrys military and intelligence agencies.Its hard for me to believe its a coincidence, Yoel Guzansky, a senior fellow at Tel Avivs Institute for National Security Studies, said of Sundays blackout. If its not a coincidence, and thats a big if, someone is trying to send a message that ‘we can limit Irans advance and we have red lines.It also sends a message that Irans most sensitive nuclear site is penetrable, he added.Netanyahu later Sunday night toasted his security chiefs, with the head of the Mossad, Yossi Cohen, at his side on the eve of his countrys Independence Day.It is very difficult to explain what we have accomplished, Netanyahu said of Israels history, saying the country had been transformed from a position of weakness into a world power.Israel typically doesnt discuss operations carried out by its Mossad intelligence agency or specialized military units. In recent weeks, Netanyahu repeatedly has described Iran as the major threat to his country as he struggles to hold onto power after multiple elections and while facing corruption charges.Speaking at the event Sunday night, Netanyahu urged his security chiefs to continue in this direction, and to continue to keep the sword of David in your hands, using an expression referring to Jewish strength.Meeting with Austin on Sunday, Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz said Israel viewed America as an ally against all threats, including Iran.The Tehran of today poses a strategic threat to international security, to the entire Middle East and to the state of Israel, Gantz said. And we will work closely with our American allies to ensure that any new agreement with Iran will secure the vital interests of the world, of the United States, prevent a dangerous arms race in our region, and protect the state of Israel.The Israeli armys chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Aviv Kochavi, also appeared to reference Iran.The Israeli militarys operations in the Middle East are not hidden from the eyes of the enemy, Kochavi said. They are watching us, seeing our abilities and weighing their steps with caution.On Saturday, Iran announced it had launched a chain of 164 IR6 centrifuges at the plant. Officials also began testing the IR9 centrifuge, which they say will enrich uranium 50 times faster than Irans firstgeneration centrifuges, the IR1. The nuclear deal limited Iran to using only IR1s for enrichment.Since thenPresident Donald Trumps withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018, Tehran has abandoned all the limits of its uranium stockpile. It now enriches up to 20 purity, a technical step away from weaponsgrade levels of 90. Iran maintains its atomic program is for peaceful purposes.The nuclear deal had granted Tehran sanctions relief in exchange for ensuring its stockpile never swelled to the point of allowing Iran to obtain an atomic bomb if it chose.On Tuesday, an Iranian cargo ship said to serve as a floating base for Irans paramilitary Revolutionary Guard forces off the coast of Yemen was struck by an explosion, likely from a limpet mine. Iran has blamed Israel for the blast. That attack escalated a longrunning shadow war in Mideast waterways targeting shipping in the region.',\n",

       " 'Irans underground Natanz nuclear facility lost power Sunday just hours after starting up new advanced centrifuges capable of enriching uranium faster, the latest incident to strike the site amid negotiations over the tattered atomic accord with world powers.As Iranian officials investigated the outage, many Israeli media outlets offered the similar assessment that a cyberattack darkened Natanz and damaged a facility that is home to sensitive centrifuges. While the reports offered no sourcing for the evaluation, Israeli media maintains a close relationship with the countrys military and intelligence agencies.If Israel caused the blackout, it further heightens the tensions between the two nations already engaged in a shadow conflict across the wider Middle East.It also complicates efforts by the U.S., Israels main security partner, to reenter the atomic accord aimed at limiting Tehrans program so it couldnt pursue a nuclear weapon if it chose. As news of the blackout emerged, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin landed in Israel on Sunday for talks with Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz.Power at Natanz had been cut across the facility comprised of aboveground workshops and underground enrichment halls, civilian nuclear program spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi told Iranian state television.We still do not know the reason for this electricity outage and have to look into it further, Kamalvandi said. Fortunately, there was no casualty or damage and there is no particular contamination or problem.Asked by the state TV correspondent if it was a technical defect or sabotage, Kamalvandi declined to comment.Malek Shariati Niasar, a Tehranbased lawmaker who serves as spokesman for the Iranian parliaments energy committee, wrote on Twitter that the incident was very suspicious, raising concerns about possible sabotage and infiltration. He said lawmakers were pursuing details of the incident as well.The Viennabased International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors Irans program, said it was aware of the media reports, but declined to comment.Natanz was largely built underground to withstand enemy airstrikes. It became a flashpoint for Western fears about Irans nuclear program in 2002, when satellite photos showed Iran building its underground centrifuges facility at the site, some 200 kilometers 125 miles south of the capital, Tehran.Natanz suffered a mysterious explosion at its advanced centrifuge assembly plant in July that authorities later described as sabotage. Iran now is rebuilding that facility deep inside a nearby mountain.Israel, Irans regional archenemy, has been suspected of carrying out that attack as well as launching other assaults, as world powers now negotiate with Tehran in Vienna over its nuclear deal.Iran also blamed Israel for the killing of a scientist who began the countrys military nuclear program decades earlier. The Stuxnet computer virus, discovered in 2010 and widely believed to be a joint U.S.Israeli creation, once disrupted and destroyed Iranian centrifuges at Natanz.Israel has not claimed any of the attacks, though Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu repeatedly has described Iran as the major threat faced by his country in recent weeks.Meeting with Austin on Sunday, Gantz said Israel viewed America as an ally against all threats, including Iran.The Tehran of today poses a strategic threat to international security, to the entire Middle East and to the state of Israel, Gantz said.

Iran on Friday released a South Korean oil tanker held since January amid a dispute with Seoul over billions of dollars of its assets frozen there.On Saturday, Iran announced it had launched a chain of 164 IR6 centrifuges at the plant.

       " 'At least 82 people were killed in one day in a crackdown by Myanmar security forces on prodemocracy protesters, according to reports Saturday from independent local media and an organization that keeps track of casualties since the February coup.Fridays death toll in Bago was the biggest oneday total for a single city since March 14, when just over 100 people were killed in Yangon, the countrys biggest city. Bago is about 100 kilometers 60 miles northeast of Yangon. The Associated Press is unable to independently verify the number of deaths.The death toll of 82 was a preliminary one compiled by the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, which issues daily counts of casualties and arrests from the crackdown in the aftermath of the Feb. 1 coup that ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi.Their tallies are widely accepted as highly credible because cases are not added until they have been confirmed, with the details published on their website.In its Saturday report, the group said that it expected the number of dead in Bago to rise as more cases were verified.The online news site Myanmar Now also reported that 82 people had been killed, citing an unnamed source involved with charity rescue work. Myanmar Now and other local media said the bodies had been collected by the military and dumped on the grounds of a Buddhist pagoda.At least 701 protesters and bystanders have been killed by security forces since the armys takeover, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners.The attack on Bago was the third in the past week involving the massive use of force to try to crush the persistent opposition to the ruling junta.Attacks were launched Wednesday on hardcore opponents of military rule who had set up strongholds in the towns of Kalay and Taze in the countrys north. In both places, at least 11 people  possibly including some bystanders  were reported killed.The security forces were accused of using heavy weapons in their attacks, including rocketpropelled grenades and mortars, though such allegations could not be independently confirmed by The Associated Press. Photos posted on social media from Bago appeared to show fragments of mortar shells.Most protests in cities and town around the country are carried out by nonviolent demonstrators who consider themselves part of a civil disobedience movement.But as the police and military escalated the use of lethal force, a hardcore faction of protesters armed themselves with homemade weapons such as firebombs in the name of selfdefense. In Kalay, activists dubbed themselves a civil army and some equipped themselves with rudimentary hunting rifles that are traditional in the remote area.A report by Myanmar Now said residents of Tamu, a town in the same region as Kalay, used hunting rifles Saturday to ambush a military convoy, and claimed to kill three soldiers.The junta has taken other measures as well to discourage resistance. It recently published a wanted list of 140 people active in the arts and journalism charged with spreading information that undermines the stability of the country and the rule of law. The penalty for the offense is up to three years imprisonment. Arrests of those on the list have been highly publicized in state media.State television channel MRTV reported Friday night that a military court had sentenced to death 19 people  17 in absentia  for allegedly killing an army officer in Yangon on March 27. The attack took place in an area of the city that is under martial law, and the court action appeared to be the first time the death sentence has been imposed under the juntas rule.The U.N. special envoy for Myanmar, Christine Schraner Burgener, arrived Friday in the Thai capital Bangkok on a regional mission to resolve the crisis in Myanmar.

He said that Biden had returned the U.S. to the Paris agreement on climate change after Donald Trump pulled out in 2017.Bangladeshi Foreign Minister A.K. Abdul Momen, who appeared with Kerry, took the opportunity to ask for U.S. help in repatriating about 1.1 million Myanmar Rohingya refugees from crowded camps in the border district of Coxs Bazar, saying they were destroying vast areas of forests and ecology.We hope that the U.S.s proactive initiative can help them for a safe and dignified return, back to their country for a decent living, he said.The refugees are victims of persecution in Myanmar, which is now military ruled since the Feb. 1 coup toppled the civilian government, and most say its unsafe to return.Momen said earlier that Bangladesh believes that adaptation to climate change is not enough and it needs support as promised by others. It should be Kerrys special target, he was quoted as saying by the United News of Bangladesh news agency.He said the countries that are mostly responsible for contributing greenhouse gases should also share responsibility of rehabilitating and protecting the people vulnerable to climate change impacts.In the UAE, the government says the impact of warmer weather, less rain, droughts, higher seas and more storms is taking its toll on infrastructure, human health and natural habitat. Kerry heard of similar challenges in talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi on Thursday, the State Department said.Bangladesh, a nation of 160 million people, shares the same predicament.Some expert warn that rising sea levels could devour much of its vast coastal region, and cyclones and tidal surge destroy agriculture and livelihood for millions. The worlds largest mangrove forest, Sundarbans, which straddles the border of Bangladesh and India, is especially vulnerable and its famous Bengal tigers at risk.The State Department said that Kerry and Modi focused on mobilizing finance to support clean energy deployment, cooperation on innovation and scaling up emerging technologies such as for energy storage, green hydrogen, clean industrial processes and sustainable urbanization and agriculture.Biden has invited 40 world leaders for the April 2223 summit, including Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.',\n",

       " 'A South Korean oil tanker held for months by Iran amid a dispute over billions of dollars seized by Seoul was freed and sailed away early Friday, just hours ahead of further talks between Tehran and world powers over its tattered nuclear deal.MarineTraffic.com data showed the MT Hankuk Chemi leaving Bandar Abbas in the early morning hours.South Koreas Foreign Ministry said Iran released the tanker and its captain after seizing the vessel in January. The ministry says the Hankuk Chemi left an Iranian port at around 6 a.m. local time after completing an administrative process.Irans Foreign Ministry spokesman, Saeed Khatibzadeh, later confirmed that Iran had released the vessel.At the request of the owner and the Korean government, the order to release the ship was issued by the prosecutor, Khatibzadeh was quoted as saying by the staterun IRNA news agency.The ships owner, DM Shipping Co. Ltd. of Busan, South Korea, could not be immediately reached for comment.The Hankuk Chemi had been traveling from a petrochemicals facility in Jubail, Saudi Arabia, to Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates when armed Revolutionary Guard troops stormed the vessel in January and forced the ship to change course and travel to Iran.Iran had accused the MT Hankuk Chemi of polluting the waters in the crucial Strait of Hormuz. But the seizure was widely seen as an attempt to pressure Seoul to release billions of dollars in Iranian assets tied up in South Korean banks amid heavy American sanctions on Iran. Iran released the 20member crew in February, but continued to detain the ship and its captain while demanding that South Korea unlock frozen Iranian assets.Irans Foreign Ministry did not acknowledge the fund dispute when announcing the ships release, with Khatibzadeh saying only that the captain and tanker had a clean record in the region.But an official from South Koreas Foreign Ministry, speaking on condition of anonymity under regulations, said Seouls willingness to resolve the issue of Iranian assets tied up in South Korea possibly had a positive influence in Irans decision to release the vessel.The official said Iran had acknowledged South Koreas attempts to resolve the dispute as it became clear the issue was not just about South Koreas ability and efforts alone and was intertwined with negotiations over the return to Tehrans foundering nuclear deal.Unfreezing the funds involves the consent of various countries including the U.S., which in 2018 imposed sweeping sanctions on Irans oil and banking sectors. The official said South Korea has been closely communicating with other countries over the frozen Iranian assets.In January, the U.N. said Iran topped a list of countries owing money to the world body with a minimum bill of over 16 million. If unpaid, Iran could lose its voting rights as required under the U.N. Charter.Were expecting to make a considerable progress in terms of paying the U.N. dues, an unnamed South Korean Foreign Ministry official was quoted by the countrys Yonhap news agency. We have also exported some 30 million worth of medical equipment since we resumed the humanitarian trade with Iran last April.The development came as Iran and world powers were set to resume negotiations in Vienna on Friday to break the standoff over U.S. sanctions against Iran and Iranian breaches of the nuclear agreement. The 2015 nuclear accord, which thenPresident Donald Trump abandoned three years later, offered Iran sanctions relief in exchange for restrictions on its nuclear program.',\n",

There are no preparations for swearingin ceremony even at the Presidents Office until Friday morning with personal secretary to President Bidya Devi Bhandari confiding that another program may run until two in the afternoon. Swearingin of ministers may happen in the evening if it happens. It may happen Sunday otherwise. The four ministers elected on ticket of Maoist Center had decided to join CPNUML instead of returning to Maoist Center after the Supreme Court on March 7 invalidated unification of the two parties that formed CPN resulting in their expulsion.']"
