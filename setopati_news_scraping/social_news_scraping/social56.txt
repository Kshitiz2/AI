Germany has extended its lockdown measures by another month and imposed several new restrictions, including largely shutting down public life over Easter, in an effort to drive down the rate of coronavirus infections.Speaking early Tuesday after a lengthy video call with the countrys 16 state governors, Chancellor Angela Merkel announced that restrictions previously set to run through March 28 will now remain in place until April 18.Coronavirus infections have increased steadily in Germany as the more contagious variant first detected in Britain has become dominant, and the countrys daily number of cases per capita has passed that of the United States.We basically have a new pandemic, Merkel told reporters in Berlin.Essentially we have a new virus, obviously of the same type but with completely different characteristics, she added. Significantly more deadly, significantly more infectious and infectious for longer.Since their last meeting three weeks ago, which saw the two sides agree a multistep plan to relax restrictions, several states have tried to avoid going back into tougher lockdowns when the weekly number of new infections exceeds 100 per 100,000 residents on three consecutive days.Merkel made clear that she wouldnt accept that.Unfortunately, we will have to make use of this emergency brake, she said.The weekly infection rate per 100,000 people stood at 107 nationwide on Monday, up from the mid60s three weeks ago.Officials agreed to largely shut down public life from April 13, adding a public holiday and shutting down most stores for the period. Public gatherings will be banned from April 15, to encourage people to stay at home.Amid concern over the rise in Germans traveling abroad on holidays, authorities also agreed on a blanket requirement for air travelers to be tested for COVID19 before boarding a flight to Germany.Drawing up legally watertight rules has proved a headache at times. A court in Germanys most populous state, North RhineWestphalia, said Monday it struck down rules requiring people to get appointments to visit shops. It said they violated a requirement that businesses get equal treatment.The state government promptly reinstated the rules, tightening them for some businesses  such as bookshops and garden centers  that were previously exempt.According to Tuesdays agreement, authorities will aim to offer free tests to all students and teachers in German schools, many of which have only recently reopened after months of remote teaching.Merkel said Germany, which had comparatively low deaths during the first phase of the pandemic last spring, has seen successes but also of setbacks and insisted that the situation would improve as more people get vaccinated.Germanys vaccination campaign has so far lagged behind expectations, with only about 9 of the population receiving at least a first shot and 4 receiving both doses by Sunday.Its difficult for longer than we thought, said Merkel. But theres definitely light visible at the end of the tunnel.Asked about the EUs plans to restrict the export of vaccines and components, Merkel said she supported efforts by the blocs executive Commission to ensure contracts are fulfilled, citing the supply problems the EU has had with the AstraZeneca shot.Britain, which left the EU last year, has strongly protested against the plans, fearing it could get cut off from deliveries.Merkel said she and French President Emmanuel Macron had each spoken to Britains Prime Minister Boris Johnson about the issue in recent days and EU leaders would aim to reach a decision in a responsible way at a virtual summit Thursday.
