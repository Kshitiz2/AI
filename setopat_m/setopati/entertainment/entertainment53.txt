They had exchanged wedding vows as per Christian rituals on Saturday."Dear priyankachopra and nickjonas. Elephants for weddings live and chains and horses are controlled with whips, spiked bits. People are rejecting elephant rides and having horsefree weddings. Congrats, but we regret it was not a happy day for animals," the animal rights organisation wrote on the microblogging site.PETA also shared its video from four years ago, highlighting the woes of the animals, titled, Captive Elephants in Jaipur PETA Indias 2014 Inspection.The couple, who left Jodhpur on Monday, are yet to respond to the remarks.Priyanka, who is a vocal asthmatic, was lambasted for hypocrisy after the sky was lit up with spectacular fireworks post the first nuptials.On Diwali, the actor had urged people not to burn firecrackers and celebrate a pollutionfree festival of lights.
