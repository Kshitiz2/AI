As he rounds out his first 100 days in office, US President Joe Bidens focus on reigning in the coronavirus during the early months of his administration seems to have paid off He can check off nearly all his campaign promises centered on the pandemic.Biden has delivered on a number of his biggest campaign pledges focused on climate change and the economy as well. But some issues have proven to be tougher for the administration  including immigration, where Biden is grappling with how to enact promised reforms in the face of a steep increase in unaccompanied minors seeking to cross the border. On some of his promises, Biden is waiting for Congress to act.Where Biden stands on some of his key promisesIMMIGRATION Raise refugee cap to 125,000, up from the 15,000 set by President Donald Trump.Nowhere close. The White House first said it would stick to Trumps 15,000 cap due to humanitarian concerns. After facing backlash from Democrats, it shifted gears and said Biden would increase the historically low cap on refugees set by Trump  but probably not all the way to the 62,500 that Biden previously had planned. And the numbers actually admitted this year are likely to be closer to 15,000. Surge humanitarian resources to the border and encourage publicprivate partnerships to deal with an increase in migration there.Yes, but is it enough The Department of Homeland Security has deployed the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help deal with the crisis a major increase of border arrivals, and Biden signed an executive order asking officials to prepare plans for using humanitarian resources there. He has yet to establish any new publicprivate partnerships. The largest number of unaccompanied children ever at the border created massive overcrowding at Customs and Border Protection facilities and set off a mad scramble for temporary space at convention centers, military bases and other large venues. Reform the U.S. asylum system.Incomplete. Biden signed an executive order in February directing his officials to craft a strategy for migration, including refugees and asylum seekers. Biden has promised to unveil a new humane asylum system but he and his aides have been mum on timing and offered no specifics. Hes eliminated some Trumpera policies, like a requirement that new asylum seekers to wait in Mexico. But he has kept a controversial Trumpera policy that allows Customs and Border Protection to expel undocumented migrants to avoid the spread of COVID19. And Biden has yet to articulate a plan to manage asylum flows beyond proposing that billions of dollars be spent to address root causes in Central America. Deliver a comprehensive immigration reform bill to Congress within his first 100 days.Done. End travel restrictions on people from a number of Muslimmajority countries.Done.

Freeze deportations for 100 days.Attempted, but blocked in court. Streamline and improve the naturalization process for green card holders.In progress. Biden signed an executive order in February ordering a plan to improve the naturalization process, and the Department of Homeland Security has since revoked some Trumpera rules, sought public input into naturalization barriers and reverted to a 2008 version of the U.S. civics test for applicants, considered more accessible than the Trumpera revamp. End family separation and create task force to reunite families separated at the border.In progress. Biden signed executive orders ending the policy and establishing a task force focused on reuniting families. The task force is making slow progress as it pores over thousands of records.

Convene a regional meeting of leaders, including officials from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico and Canada, to address the factors driving migration and propose a regional resettlement solution.Not yet. Vice President Kamala Harris, tasked with dealing with the root causes of migration, has spoken to the leaders of Mexico and Guatemala, but no regional meeting is on the horizon. Protect those often described as dreamers  young immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents  and their families by reinstating DACA, the Obamaera policy defending thems from deportation.Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in March his agency was issuing a rule to preserve and fortify DACA, but the policy faces a Texas court challenge that could invalidate protections for those often decribed as dreamers. Ensure that personnel within Immigration and Customs Enforcement and within Customs and Border Protection abide by professional standards and are held accountable for inhumane treatment.Biden included funding for training and investigating misconduct in his immigration bill and in the budget he proposed to Congress. His administration has faced questions about allegations of abuse in at least one Texas facility, which are being investigated. End prolonged migrant detention and invest in a casemanagement system to process people.Theres been no announcement of added investments in casemanagement systems. The administration did roll out plans to release parents and children within 72 hours of their arrival in the United States in March. Officials subsequently acknowledged that hundreds of children have been held by Border Patrol for much longer, due to an increase in unaccompanied minors arriving at the border and a lack of facilities to house them.DOMESTIC POLICY Reverse transgender military ban.Done.

The aid package approved right before Biden became president offered 600 in direct payments to eligible Americans. Biden said the payment should have been 2,000.

Biden has directly raised concerns with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Hong Kong, human rights abuses against Uyghur and ethnic minorities in the western Xinjiang province, and its actions toward Taiwan. Hes repeatedly raised concerns about the jailing and treatment of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. But Biden declined to hold Saudi Arabias crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, directly responsible for the killing of U.S.based journalist Jamal Khashoggi even after the publication of U.S. intelligence showing Salman approved of the hit. Improving relations with allies who had rocky relations with Trump.Mostly accomplished. Allies like Canadas Justin Trudeau and Germanys Angela Merkel, who had stormy relationships with Trump, have praised Biden for his efforts reclaim U.S. leadership on climate issues, and leaders in the IndoPacific have been pleased by early efforts at coordination on China policy. Reversing the embrace of dictators and tyrants like Putin and Kim Jong Un.Mostly accomplished. Biden has levied two rounds of sanctions against the Russians. His administration decided to be measured in its approach with Putin and has said that hes interested in finding areas where the U.S. and Russia can find common ground. Bidens team acknowledges they have sought to reengage with North Korea, but have been rebuffed. Quickly rejoin the nuclear deal with Iran so long as Tehran comes back into compliance.Mixed. Indirect talks are under way among other signatories of the 2015 deal, including British, German, French, Chinese and Russian officials, with American officials down the hall. But the path forward is less than certain as Tehran has thus far refused to come into compliance with the old deal without sanctions relief and it recently began enriching uranium to its highest purity ever. Recognize World War Iera atrocities against Armenians as genocide.Completed. As a candidate, Biden said, if elected, hed make it U.S. policy to recognize the killings and mass deportations by Ottoman Empire forces of hundreds of thousands of Armenians more than a century ago  something past presidents have avoided doing out of concern of angering strategic ally Turkey. Biden followed through on the promise on the annual commemoration Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day. Turkey swiftly condemned the move.
