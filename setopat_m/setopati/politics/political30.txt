Prime Minister PM KP Sharma Oli proposed to hold byelection for vacant House of Representatives HoR seats during the allparty meeting at Baluwatar on Saturday raising further questions about the general convention of Nepali Congress NC that already looks in doubt due to delay in distribution and renewal of active membership.NC Vicepresident Bimalendra Nidhi rejected the proposal outright pointing that the main opposition party has already scheduled its general convention from August 2326. NC President Sher Bahadur Deuba also said byelection cannot coincide with the general convention.But Oli pointed that byelection should be held within six months of the seats becoming vacant and assured that he is ready to pave the way for further delaying the general convention. NCs general convention is a serious issue. We will see about your general convention. Lets hold the byelection in August, Oli stated.Deuba, whose fouryear term expired in March 2020, had given himself a oneyear term extension which meant his term would expire on March 3, 2021. The party had also decided to hold the next general convention from February 1922, 2021. But it could not be held due to the COVID19 pandemic.NC delayed the general convention further taking help from the Constitution which has a provision of a sixmonth extension for parties in special circumstances. Provided that in case election of the office bearers could not be held within five years due to situation arising out of special circumstance, there shall be no hindrance to make provision in the statute of a political party to hold such election within a period of six months, states the provision in Article 2694b of the Constitution related to political parties.The Constitution will have to be amended to delay the general convention beyond August. PM Oli did not explicitly talked about Constitution amendment but he hinted at that by saying that he is ready to pave the way for postponing the general convention.
