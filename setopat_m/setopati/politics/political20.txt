Deuba Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba is also talking tough after prorogation of the House. Once NC is ready to form government, environment will be created even for Janata Samajwadi Party JSP to be ready, a standing committee member quoted Dahal as saying during the meeting. Dahal claimed that the situation is getting unfavorable for Prime Minister PM KP Sharma Oli after the developments in Karnali, Lumbini and Gandaki provinces.

We will formally write stating that we dont support the government, Maoist Center Spokesperson Narayan Kaji Shrestha said after the meeting.He added that the party is taking initiative to topple this government and form a new government.
