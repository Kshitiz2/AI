A joint WHOChina study on the origins of COVID19 says that transmission of the virus from bats to humans through another animal is the most likely scenario and that a lab leak is extremely unlikely, according to a draft copy obtained by The Associated Press.The findings were largely as expected and left many questions unanswered. The team proposed further research in every area except the lab leak hypothesis.The reports release has been repeatedly delayed, raising questions about whether the Chinese side was trying to skew the conclusions to prevent blame for the pandemic falling on China. A World Health Organization official said late last week that he expected it would be ready for release in the next few days.The AP received what appeared to be a nearfinal version on Monday from a Genevabased diplomat from a WHOmember country. It wasnt clear whether the report might still be changed prior to its release. The diplomat did not want to be identified because they were not authorized to release it ahead of publication.The researchers listed four scenarios in order of likelihood. They concluded that transmission through a second animal was likely to very likely. They evaluated direct spread from bats to humans as likely, and said that spread through coldchain food products was possible but not likely.The closest relative of the virus that causes COVID19 has been found in bats, which are known to carry coronaviruses. However, the report says that the evolutionary distance between these bat viruses and SARSCoV2 is estimated to be several decades, suggesting a missing link.It said that highly similar viruses have been found in pangolins, but also noted that mink and cats are susceptible to the COVID virus, which suggests they could be carriers.The report is based largely on a visit by a WHO team of international experts to Wuhan, the Chinese city where COVID19 was first detected, from midJanuary to midFebruary.Peter Ben Embarek, the WHO expert who led the Wuhan mission, said Friday that the report had been finalized and was being factchecked and translated.I expect that in the next few days, that whole process will be completed and we will be able to release it publicly, he said.
