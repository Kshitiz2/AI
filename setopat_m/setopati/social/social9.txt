How long does protection from COVID19 vaccines lastExperts dont know yet because theyre still studying vaccinated people to see when protection might wear off. How well the vaccines work against emerging variants will also determine if, when and how often additional shots might be needed.We only have information for as long as the vaccines have been studied, said Deborah Fuller, a vaccine researcher at the University of Washington. We have to study the vaccinated population and start to see, at what point do people become vulnerable again to the virusSo far, Pfizers ongoing trial indicates the companys twodose vaccine remains highly effective for at least six months, and likely longer. People who got Modernas vaccine also still had notable levels of virusfighting antibodies six months after the second required shot.Antibodies also dont tell the whole story. To fight off intruders like viruses, our immune systems also have another line of defense called B and T cells, some of which can hang around long after antibody levels dwindle. If they encounter the same virus in the future, those battletested cells could potentially spring into action more quickly.Even if they dont prevent illness entirely, they could help blunt its severity. But exactly what role such memory cells might play with the coronavirus  and for how long  isnt yet known.While the current COVID19 vaccines will likely last for at least about a year, they probably wont offer lifelong protection, as with measles shots, said Dr. Kathleen Neuzil, a vaccine expert at the University of Maryland.Its going to be somewhere in the middle of that very wide range, she said.Variants are another reason we might need an additional shot.The current vaccines are designed to work against a particular spike protein on the coronavirus, said Mehul Suthar of the Emory Vaccine Center. If the virus mutates enough over time, vaccines might need to be updated to boost their effectiveness.So far, the vaccines appear protective against the notable variants that have emerged, though somewhat less so on the one first detected in South Africa.If it turns out we need another shot, a single dose could extend protection of the current shots or contain vaccination for one or more variants.The need for followup shots will also depend partly on the success of the vaccination push globally, and tamping down transmission of the virus and emerging variants.
